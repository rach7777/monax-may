##BLOCKCHAIN
 
A blockchain is an encrypted database which automatically processes, broadcasts, and validates  authorised transactions, and prevents the incorporation of unauthorised transactions, on a database which is distributed widely across a network of computers.
 
Blockchains carry out their functions automatically, requiring neither servers nor human administrators to operate themselves reliably and predictably.  They accomplish this through a process known as “mining,” whereby the databases incentivise users to secure the network by awarding them with valuable tokens, such as bitcoins, in exchange.

“Mining” is, in our view, a poor description for “automated database management.” Eris Industries uses blockchains which do not require distributed mining and where database management is instead delegated to a blockchain’s commercial operator.
 
##SMART CONTRACTS

Take some data-driven interactions - any interactions you like - and establish:
     
-what the different users agree are the specified parameters for the interactions; 
-the data that will be used to measure the interactions;
-the sequence of the interactions;
-the rules of the interactions; and
-what should happens when the limits of the data’s ability to describe the interactions are crossed.

Put that on an Eris blockchain, and you’ve got a smart contract.

Smart contracts are modular, repeatable, autonomous agents which you can use to build distributed and secure software applications for yourself, for a community, for a client, for a bounty, or even just for fun. They can be mixed and matched, and easy to iterate, rather like lego bricks combined with pre-set templates.

Smart contracts can be coded to reflect any kind of business or engineering logic which is data-driven: from actions as simple as up-voting a post on Reddit, to the more complex such as loan collateralisation and futures contracts, to the highly complex such as repayment prioritisation on a structured note.

Relationships and obligations which are 'smart contractified' benefit from blockchain security logic in the same way as a bitcoin balance benefits from that same security logic today.
 
##SMART CONTRACT SYSTEMS
 
A smart contract system is an interconnected array of smart contracts designed to replicate complex data-driven human relationships, such as social networks, employment relationships or securities trading systems.
 
By ensuring all contracts on a given system are interoperable and not merely stand-alone, smart contract systems are capable of describing and automating highly complex business processes in a secure and predictable way. 
 
##DAPPS
 
A distributed application, or **Dapp**, is a user-friendly web application which utilises a smart contract back-end.
 
Eris Industries’ smart contract systems have been purposefully built to be compatible with, and rely upon, the advances in html, css, and Javascript technology which make possible the wonderful advances in web applications we see today. 
 
Dapps will feel no different from the web applications in common use today, such as GitHub or Facebook, with the added benefit of employing elegant blockchain security architecture which renders these applications highly secure and very simple to administer.

Dapps make possible new kinds of applications, for example, a social network where neither the operator nor any unauthorised third party could see the content of a user’s account, or a trading platform which operates with reduced dependence on third-party cloud services providers.
 
In other words, Dapps are the next generation of the web: users can obtain all of the utility of the internet, while retaining absolute control over their personal data with services that incentivise privacy by their very design.
