The network can be represented simply as a layer of delegated structure processing. Like the abstracted layer for data processing that is the “cloud”, the blockchain is merely an abstracted layer for computation and the delegation of information processing. In an ideal system, with a universal “cloud-chain”, backing up your data is as simple as sending a file. In this network, joining is as simple as sending information along with a computable structure file that specifies the intent, or the “contract”, upon which the logic applies. 

Transactions which seek to modify a distributed, blockchain database are governed by smart contracts, scripts which are capable of self-executing and self-enforcing any relationship which is reducible to code. Different types of actions for different contracts can be pre-set according to a particular platform operator's parameters – if a relationship can be expressed in code, it can be run.
