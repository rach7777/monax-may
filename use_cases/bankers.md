Just about anything that involves managing data without scaling up your physical and human infrastructure to do it. Some of the things we've tinkered with: 

* [An automatic bank](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/03/11/solidity-1/).
* Really. [We're not kidding](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/03/12/solidity-2/). The future of banking is in process automation, and smart contract-capable blockchains can go a long way towards accomplishing that.
* [Back-office business process automation](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-std-lib/blob/master/examples/payroll.sol).
* [Real-time gross settlement systems](https://bankers.eris.industries/#/26). Clearing and settlement is easy with an ErisDB! Post-trade processing should be possible too. Just write your application, roll your chain [in one command](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/04/25/make-thelonious-chain/) and you're off to the races. Bye-bye, buildings, servers, and employees.
* Re clearing this includes FX, securities, whatever else - all doable. If you can write it, an Eris blockchain will run it.
* [Securitisation and risk transfer](https://db.erisindustries.com/distributed%20business/2015/04/28/smart-securitisation/).
* Asset creation and tracking and event control, as implemented by our friends over at [Everledger.io](http://www.everledger.io/smart_contracts). Here's our [tutorial](https://db.erisindustries.com/legal%20tech/2015/05/01/tracking-digits/) on how to get your own system rolling.
* Task management and reputation management, as implemented by [Microwork](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/20313/microwork-io-uses-smart-contracts-coordinate-small-tasks-worldwide/).
* Digital identity. We're currently in discussions on how Eris can be used for this purpose with our friends at [Identifi.org](http://identifi.org) ([repo](https://github.com/identifi/identifi)).
* [Corporate decisionmaking](https://github.com/project-douglas/eris) and coordination such as bondholder or shareholder resolutions.
* Or just making a really [killer interactive web application](http://blog.confluent.io/2015/05/27/using-logs-to-build-a-solid-data-infrastructure-or-why-dual-writes-are-a-bad-idea/). We made a distributed streaming video app we call [2Gather](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/04/07/2gather/) ([repo here](https://github.com/eris-ltd/2gather)).

Of course, there are a whole bunch of things we're working on behind the scenes for our clients which we can't talk about. But this should give you a good idea of the wide range of things smart contracts can do!
