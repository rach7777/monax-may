Just about anything that involves managing data without scaling up your physical and human infrastructure to do it. 

Some of the things we've tinkered with: 

* [A bank](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/03/11/solidity-1/). ...[Really](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/03/12/solidity-2/).
* [Back-office process automation](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-std-lib/blob/master/examples/payroll.sol).
* [Real-time gross settlement systems](https://bankers.eris.industries/#/26). Clearing and settlement is easy with an ErisDB! Just write your application, roll your chain [in one command](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/04/25/make-thelonious-chain/) and you're off to the races. Bye-bye, buildings, servers, and employees.
* [Securitisation and risk transfer](https://db.erisindustries.com/distributed%20business/2015/04/28/smart-securitisation/).
* Asset creation and tracking and event control, as implemented by our friends over at [Everledger.io](http://www.everledger.io/smart_contracts).
* [Corporate decisionmaking](https://github.com/project-douglas/eris) and coordination such as bondholder or shareholder resolutions.
* Task management and reputation management, as implemented by [Microwork](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/20313/microwork-io-uses-smart-contracts-coordinate-small-tasks-worldwide/).

Of course, there are a whole bunch of things we're working on behind the scenes for our clients which we can't talk about. But this should give you a good idea of the wide range of things smart contracts can do!
