The Eris Package Manager (**EPM**) allows Ethereum contract developers to deploy Thelonious smart contracts straight from sublime to their Thelonious clients via rpc. 

In addition to deploying contracts from sublime to the Thelonious client, EPM has other features as well, including:
•	keeping a log of the smart contracts which have been deployed so that you can then easily transact with those smart contracts;
•	allowing users to transact with smart contracts that have been deployed from sublime as well as any others;
•	allowing users to query smart contract storage;
•	allowing users to deploy a sequence of smart contracts; and
•	allowing users to start, stop, and restart servers with predefined options.

All commands are available from the command palette.
