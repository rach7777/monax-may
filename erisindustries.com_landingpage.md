**AUTONOMOUS - SERVERLESS - SECURE**

**THELONIOUS** - the world’s first smart contract-controlled blockchain

#WHAT IS ERIS?

Eris Industries designs and builds software, utilising enterprise-grade encryption, which allows developers to create applications that leverage all of the utility of the modern internet, but without servers. 

Using **blockchain** [LINK TO GLOSSARY] technology similar to that of Bitcoin protocol and its many imitators and a system of **smart contracts** [LINK TO GLOSSARY], Eris Industries systems allow the creation of web applications that can be safely, securely, and reliably deployed on the public internet at a substantially reduced cost when compared to existing dedicated server or cloud-based solutions. Such applications are known as 'distributed applications,' or **Dapps** [LINK TO GLOSSARY].

Best of all, there is no reason that an Eris platform has to be anything but free to use - easy to set up, easy to parameterise, and functional. Today. 

#WHAT DOES ERIS CONSIST OF?

Eris is a full software stack which includes

...**Thelonious**, the world’s first smart contract-controlled blockchain protocol, and 

...**the DeCerver**, the world’s first decentralised application server. 

#WHY SHOULD I USE ERIS?

Complex data-driven relationships between people and business require increasingly complex software design infrastructure. Today, Google-scale infrastructure is required to manage these relationships. Distributed infrastructure, however, can perform these tasks much more efficiently. 

Through the use of blockchain cryptography, Eris Industries simplifies this software design while providing much of the same utility as traditional, server-based platforms. Furthermore, Eris Industries does so without needing to fork or otherwise modify existing blockchain protocols, allowing users to develop blockchain-secure applications which can interact with existing decentralised protocols without needing to rely upon them.

Any type of information - whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely tracked and transferred on an Eris system. Because Eris Industries uses systems of smart contracts rather than cryptographic tokens to represent this information, Eris systems allow corporate, for the first time, to benefit from blockchain security architecture while obtaining substantial functionality which is capable of complying with any and all applicable regulatory requirements. 

#ERIS FOR DEVELOPERS

##Design philosophy

Most blockchains in use today are built to transfer tokens representing monetary value among a network of mutually untrustworthy actors. As such, they are built to be standalone monoliths and their security and consensus models are stagnant and resistant to change. 

Modern internet services require flexibility and adaptability on the part of platform operators and service providers, who are incentivised to conduct themselves properly out of good commercial practice. Developers wishing to utilise blockchain technology deserve a platform which allows them to benefit from purpose-built distributed blockchain architecture without being tied to ossified protocols which are not fit for purpose. 

##Thelonious

This is why we have designed **Thelonious**, a protocol which is not designed to be one blockchain, but millions of them, each tailor-made by developers for specific contexts. Thelonious allows for the easy and secure deployment of blockchain-absed applications without needing to spend vast sums of money on servers or mining hardware to secure them. 

We have reconfigured the network protocol used by most blockchains so that Thelonious will work within existing enterprise routing and firewall infrastructure, so the platform should be useable by individuals, small businesses, and large enterprises alike. 

Unlike existing alternatives, a single Thelonious client is all that is required in order to participate in and interact with any Thelonious blockchain and other blockchains, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin (functionality for which is included out of the box).

#ERIS FOR ENTERPRISE

Eris is the first platform that allows the full potential of blockchain based technologies to be realized in enterprise. By combining blockchains systems of smart contracts, businesses can take any data-driven human relationship and reduce it to code – guaranteeing accurate and consistent execution of functions which hitherto required human discretion to manage. 

We’re working with a number of corporations to discuss how our technology can assist their businesses. If you have a query relating to how our solutions can be put to use in your firm, please contact the team at info@erisindustries.com .
