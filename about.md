Eris Industries began with a question: is it possible to make web applications which have all the benefits of interconnectedness which we gain with modern web applications, but without servers? Could such a thing even be done? 

The answer is that it can. 

While web technologies have greatly sped up innovation in many areas, the movement of users away from isolated computers using standalone pieces of software toward web applications has raised concerns in some corners as to users' data privacy and resilience of the data silos on which modernity increasingly relies. 

Current free-to-use internet services, from search to e-mail to social networking, are dependent on advertising revenue to fund their operations. As a result, companies offering these services must - to paraphrase Satoshi Nakamoto - ‘hassle their users for considerably more information than they would otherwise need.’ 

This necessity has skewed the internet toward a more centralized infrastructure and usability system than it was intended, and has resulted in users having to surrender their privacy to obtain these web services' utility.

Where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were designed to solve this problem in relation to point-of-sale and banking transactions, Eris Industries is working on solving this issue for internet-based communications, social networking and other applications - bearing in mind that for free internet services such as e-mail, social networking, search and "open data," intrusion into users' private lives and the accumulation and centralisation of vast quantities of personal information in centralised silos is not some minor and ancillary nuisance: [data security breaches are positively commonplace, with breaches increasing in number and attendant costs increasing as well](http://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/data-protection/the-15-worst-data-security-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html).

A smarter, safer world doesn't require more “big data.” It doesn't more Google-scale companies to manage it. It doesn't need Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to mine and sell their users' identities for the sake of advertising revenue. And it certainly doesn't need large companies to compromise any more of their customers' personal data. 

It needs a uniform, participatory architecture that simplifies our interactions with information while giving users back control over their data. Above all, it needs to be completely free to use. 

Ordinary users and corporations alike deserve to benefit from the interconnectivity of the web and the security of the blockchain without the drawbacks of either.  

We’re here to make that happen. 

Details to follow in 2015.
