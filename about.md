“It is the function… of all action… to interrupt what otherwise would have proceeded automatically and therefore predictably.”

 -Hannah Arendt
 
Technology amplifies human potential. It gives individuals both greater power to perform work and improved methods to simplify it.

In the words of the political philosopher Carlota Perez, the beginning of the 20th century “witnessed the... boundless rise of two forces: the information revolution and financial markets.” All of this was enabled by vast increases in processing power. But for all our faster computing, we’re remain burdened by layered, siloed complexity. We’re constrained by legacy systems we know to be imperfect, yet refuse to upgrade. There has to be a better way to mediate data-driven interactions at a large scale.

A smarter world doesn't require more “big data.” It doesn't more Google-scale companies to manage it. It doesn't need platforms with exponentially increasing complexity. It needs a uniform, participatory architecture that simplifies and naturalizes our interactions with information and our capacity to coordinate. 

It needs to be secure, easy to create and maintain, and designed so that all information is logically structured by default. That’s why we built Eris v 0.1 as part of Project Douglas in June 2014. And it is why we are building Eris v 0.2 now. 

There will eventually be millions of blockchains in the technology space - all interacting with each other and other database technologies through oracles or other authorized actors. Ordinary users deserve to benefit from the interconnectivity of the web and the security of the blockchain without the security or commercial drawbacks either platform presents today. We’re going to make that happen. 

Announcements to follow in Q1 2015.
