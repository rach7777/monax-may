Eris Industries began with a question: is it possible to make web applications which have all the benefits of interconnectedness which we gain with modern web applications, but without servers or the added cost of pay-to-play cryptocurrency blockchains? Could such a thing even be done? 

The answer is that it can. 

Current free-to-use internet services, from search to e-mail to social networking, are dependent on advertising revenue to fund their operations. As a result, companies offering these services must - to paraphrase Satoshi Nakamoto - ‘hassle their users for considerably more information than they would otherwise need.’ As a result, users of the Facebooks and Gmails of the world begrudgingly accept a loss of privacy in order to obtain these services' utility.

Ordinary people and corporations alike deserve open-source solutions which will allow them to benefit from the interconnectivity of the web, and the security of the blockchain, with the drawbacks of neither.  [That's why we built Eris 0.1 in June and why we're building Eris 1.0 now.](https://eris.projectdouglas.org/bounty_submission.html) 

Where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were designed to solve this problem in relation to point-of-sale and banking transactions, Eris Industries is working on solving this issue for internet-based communications, social networking and other applications - bearing in mind that for free internet services such as e-mail, social networking, search and "open data," intrusion into users' private lives and the accumulation and centralisation of vast quantities of personal information in centralised silos is not some minor nuisance: [data security breaches are positively commonplace, with breaches increasing in number and attendant costs increasing as well](http://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/data-protection/the-15-worst-data-security-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html).

A smarter, safer world doesn't require more “big data.” It doesn't need another Google-scale company to manage it. It doesn't need Silicon Valley to mine and sell your identity to advertisers. 

It needs a uniform, participatory architecture that simplifies our interactions with information while putting control of personal data where it belongs: with the user. 

Web 3.0 launches in 2015.
