Technology amplifies human potential. It gives individuals both greater power to perform work and improved methods to simplify it.

As put by Carlota Perez, the beginning of the 20th century “witnessed the... boundless rise of two forces: the information revolution and financial markets.” All of this was enabled by vast increases in processing power. But for all our faster computing, we remain burdened by layered, siloed complexity. There has to be a better way to mediate data-driven interactions at a large scale.

A smarter world doesn't require more “big data.” It doesn't more Google-scale companies to manage it. It needs a uniform, participatory architecture that simplifies and naturalizes our interactions with information and our capacity to coordinate, whether through social networking, financial infrastructure, or secure communications.

Furthermore, in order to be useful, any such platform needs to be 

    easy to create and free to use; 
    cryptographically secure; and
    capable of full legal compliance by default. 
    
Ordinary users and corporations alike deserve to benefit from the interconnectivity of the web and the security of the blockchain without the drawbacks of either platform as they're currently used.  

We’re here to make that happen. That’s why we built [Eris v 0.1 in June 2014](https://eris.projectdouglas.org) and it is why we are building Eris v 1.0 now. 

Details to follow in 2015.
