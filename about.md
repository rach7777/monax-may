“It is the function… of all action… to interrupt what otherwise would have proceeded automatically and therefore predictably.”

 -Hannah Arendt
 
Technology amplifies human potential. It gives individuals both greater power to perform work and improved methods to simplify it.

In the words of the political philosopher Carlota Perez, the beginning of the 20th century “witnessed the... boundless rise of two forces: the information revolution and financial markets.” All of this was enabled by vast increases in processing power. But for all our faster computing, we remain burdened by layered, siloed complexity. There has to be a better way to mediate data-driven interactions at a large scale.

A smarter world doesn't require more “big data.” It doesn't more Google-scale companies to manage it. It needs a uniform, participatory architecture that simplifies and naturalizes our interactions with information and our capacity to coordinate, whether through social media, bank infrastructure or even payment processing systems. 

It needs to be secure, compliant with all applicable laws, easy to create and inexpensive to maintain, and designed so that all information is logically structured by default. Ordinary users and corporations alike deserve to benefit from the interconnectivity of the web and the security of the blockchain without the drawbacks either platform presents today. 

We’re here to make that happen. That’s why we built [Eris v 0.1 in June 2014](https://eris.projectdouglas.org) and it is why we are building Eris v 1.0 now. 

Announcements to follow in Q1 2015.
