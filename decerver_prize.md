NOTE: Proposed DeCerver prize bounties. Amends/suggestions welcome

Following all that Ethereum-Counterparty ballyhoo back in November, we figured we'd get on the Reverse Implementation Train by offering the first annual DeCerver Prize: a prize Eris Industries will award annually to the person or group who makes the most kick-ass decentralised application (or Dapp) on the platform. 

To get you started this year, we are offering the following bounties:

1) 150,000 (one hundred fifty thousand) Dogecoin to the person or group of people to build Counterparty on the DeCerver.

2) 500,000 (five hundred thousand) Dogecoin to the person or group to build MaidSafe on the DeCerver.

3) 1,000,000 (one million) Dogecoin and a job interview with the entire dev team for the new role of Core Developer (Communications) to the person to build a fully-functioning Facebook-type social network on the DeCerver. Unless you want to just go and run the DeFacebook for a living, which we're cool with too.

Winners of the DeCerver Prize will get kudos on our company blog and invited to hang out with us because why not.

In each case, the first person/group to put the best working implementation on GitHub and get it signed off by our highly evolved team of hacker marmots wins.

Style points will be awarded for any cool features, especially if they relate to marmots. 

Happy hacking.
