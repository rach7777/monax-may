#The DeCerver: the world's first decentralised application server

##Design philosophy

Increasingly complex data-driven interactions between customers and businesses do not require increasingly complex software design; they require a reevaluation of data ownership on the one hand, and increased utility of the data collected on the other. The deCerver helps businesses build applications which leverage opt-in data ownership and significantly increase data utility for both customers and businesses. 

##The DeCerver

Using blockchain technology similar to that of Bitcoin and its many imitators, the deCerver allows the creation of web style, data driven, interactive applications that can be safely, securely, and reliably deployed at a substantially reduced cost compared to existing dedicated server or cloud-based systems.

The DeCerver includes a number of functions straight out of the box, including an API server front-end which ensures the DeCerver can always be accessed via a normal web browser at localhost, decentralized databases (blockchains) a decentralized filesystem (IPFS is compiled by default), a scripts runner, and a legal integrator to incorporate legalmarkdown-based contracts into your smart contract stack - effectively putting the "contract" into "smart contracts."

Interaction with existing blockchain protocols, too, is straightforward with the Eris stack: whether developers wish to build systems that utilize Bitcoin, Ethereum, Thelonious, or a combination of these blockchains (all of which are compiled by default), all through a single Thelonious client. If and when other blockchains come online, we will happily accept pull requests for interfaces which wrap those packages as well. 

From a platform operatorâ€™s perspective, the Eris stack means blockchain technology is now easily usable in a fully legally-compliant enterprise context for the first time. From a developer's perspective, the DeCerver substantially lowers barriers to entry to new, innovative and secure web application architecture, while allowing users to participate in the scaling and data security of the application.
