#The DeCerver: the world's first decentralised application server

##Design philosophy

Increasingly complex data-driven interactions between customers and businesses do not require increasingly complex software design; they require a reevaluation of data ownership on the one hand, and increased utility of the data collected on the other. The deCerver helps businesses build applications which leverage opt-in data ownership and significantly increase data utility for both customers and businesses.

Using blockchain technology similar to that of Bitcoin and its many imitators, the deCerver allows the creation of web style, data driven, interactive applications that can be safely, securely, and reliably deployed at a substantially reduced cost compared to existing dedicated server or cloud-based systems.

From a platform operator’s perspective, the Eris stack means blockchain technology is now easily usable in a fully legally-compliant enterprise context for the first time. Integration of a legal compliance mechanism is built as a core component of the deCerver. This legal integration component means that applications built on the deCerver are able to effectively put the ‘contract' into 'smart contracts.'

Interaction with existing blockchain protocols, too, is straightforward with the Eris stack, whether developers wish to build systems that utilize Bitcoin, Ethereum, Thelonious, or a combination of these blockchains (all of which are included out of the box). The deCerver significantly lowers the barrier to entry, all while allowing users to participate in the scaling and data security of the application.
