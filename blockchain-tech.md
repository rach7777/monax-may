The key component of an Eris system is a database known as a blockchain, which has its origin in cryptocurrency platforms such as Bitcoin, which use them to represent verifiable monetary stake. In second-generation platforms, such as Ethereum, blockchains are generalized to store arbitrary data and to establish permissions to modify that data through a set of self-enforcing and self-executing scripts. These are known as “smart contracts,” and they allow platform operators to define complex and fully customisable rules which govern the blockchain’s interaction with its users. 

There is no pre-sale, there are no tokens, and there is no reason that an Eris platform should be anything but free to use.
