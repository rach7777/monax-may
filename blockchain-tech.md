The key component of an Eris system is a database known as a blockchain, which has its origin in cryptocurrency platforms such as Bitcoin, which use them to represent verifiable monetary stake. 

In second-generation cryptocurrency platforms, such as Ethereum, blockchains are generalized to store arbitrary data and to establish permissions to modify that data through a set of self-enforcing and self-executing scripts. These are known as “smart contracts,” and they allow platform operators to define complex and fully customisable rules which govern the blockchain’s interaction with its users. 

Different types of actions for different contracts can be pre-set according to a particular platform operator's parameters – if a relationship can be expressed in code, it can be run on the chain. Like the abstracted layer for data processing that is "the cloud", the blockchain is merely an abstracted layer for computation and the delegation of information processing. In an ideal system, with a universal "cloud-chain", backing up your data is as simple as sending a file. In this network, joining is as simple as sending information along with a computable structure file that specifies the intent, or the "contract", upon which the logic applies.

Unlike other projects in the space, however, there is no "pre-sale" and there are no tokens. Indeed, there is no reason that an Eris platform should be anything but free to use.
