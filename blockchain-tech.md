The key component of an Eris system is a database known as a blockchain, which has its origin in cryptocurrency platforms such as Bitcoin, which use them to represent verifiable monetary stake. In second-generation platforms, such as Ethereum, blockchains are generalized to store arbitrary data and to establish permissions to modify that data through a set of self-enforcing and self-executing scripts. These are known as “smart contracts,” and they allow platform operators to define complex and fully customisable rules which govern the blockchain’s interaction with its users. 

Eris is a full-stack solution which uses blockchain architecture to provide free-of-charge services that inherently incentivise user privacy and transaction security. When we release our platform to the public in early 2015, there is absolutely no reason that its functionality should be anything but free to use.
