The key component of an Eris system is a database known as a blockchain, which has its origin in cryptocurrency platforms such as Bitcoin, which use them to represent verifiable monetary stake. In second-generation platforms, such as Ethereum, blockchains are generalized to store arbitrary data and to establish permissions to modify that data through a set of self-enforcing and self-executing scripts. These are known as “smart contracts,” and they allow platform operators to define complex and fully customisable rules which govern the blockchain’s interaction with its users. 

Eris is a full-stack solution which uses blockchain architecture to provide free-of-charge services that inherently incentivise user privacy and transaction security. When we release our platform to the public in early 2015, it will include 

a decentralized server, or deCerver, which will provide an API frontend for interacting with the rest of the system; 

a decentralised file store; 

a contract deployment and modification system, and 

a custom blockchain layer.

Unlike most (if not all) other blockchain-based platforms, there is absolutely no reason that an Eris-based platform's functionality should be anything but free to use.
