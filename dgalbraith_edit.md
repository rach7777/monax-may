Self-operating, serverless, distributed applications

**THELONIOUS** - the world’s first smart contract-controlled blockchain

#WHAT IS ERIS?

Eris Industries designs and builds enterprise-grade software which allows developers to create applications that leverage all of the utility of the modern internet, but without servers. 

Using blockchain technology similar to that of Bitcoin protocol and its many imitators, Eris Industries systems allow the creation of web applications that can be safely, securely, and reliably deployed on the public internet at a substantially reduced cost compared to existing dedicated server or cloud-based solutions. 

Any type of information - whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely tracked and transferred on an Eris system. 

#WHAT DOES ERIS CONSIST OF?

Eris is a full software stack which includes

...**Thelonious**, the world’s first smart contract-controlled blockchain protocol, and 
...**the DeCerver**, the world’s first decentralised application server. 

#WHY SHOULD I USE ERIS?
 =======

Complex data-driven relationships between people and business require increasingly complex software design infrastructure. Today, Google-scale infrastructure is required to manage these relationships. Distributed infrastructure, however, can perform these tasks much more efficiently. 

Through the use of blockchain cryptography, Eris Industries simplifies this software design while providing much of the same utility as traditional, server-based platforms.

Most importantly, unlike existing alternatives in the market, including Bitcoin, Eris systems do not need to rely on token monetisation to run and secure themselves from external attack. Thelonius is purpose-built so that it can easily be deployed to a variety of contexts.

From a user's perspective, there is thus no reason that an Eris system should be anything but free to use. From a platform operator’s perspective, Eris means that blockchain technology can be used in a fully legally-compliant fashion in an enterprise context without needing to worry about any of the regulatory hurdles interation with existing blockchain protocols currently involves.

#ERIS FOR DEVELOPERS

##Design philosophy

Most blockchains in use today are built to transfer tokens representing monetary value among a network of mutually untrustworthy actors. As such, they are built to be standalone monoliths and their security and consensus models are stagnant and resistant to change. 

We at Eris Industries know that "trustlessness" is a misnomer: even the most ardent user of Bitcoin extends trust regularly, whether to the banks and exchanges that process USD transfers, or to the manufacturers of their computers and operating systems. The provision of modern internet services requires flexibility and adaptability on the part of platform operators and service providers, who are incentivised to conduct themselves properly out of good commercial practice. 

Developers wishing to utilise deserve a platform which allows them to benefit from purpose-built distributed blockchain architecture without being tied to stagnant and ossified protocols which are simply not capable of forming the backbone of a distributed internet. 

##Thelonious

This is why we have designed **Thelonious**, a protocol which is not designed to be one blockchain, but millions of them, each tailor-made by developers for specific contexts. Thelonious allows for the easy and secure deployment of blockchain-absed applications without needing to spend vast sums of money on servers or mining hardware to secure them. 

We have reconfigured the network protocol used by most blockchains so that Thelonious will work within existing enterprise routing and firewall infrastructure, so the platform should be useable by individuals, small businesses, and large enterprises alike. 

Unlike existing alternatives, a single Thelonious client is all that is required in order to participate in and interact with any Thelonious blockchain and other blockchains, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin (functionality for which is included out of the box). 

#ERIS FOR ENTERPRISE

Eris is the first platform that allows the full potential of blockchain based technologies to be realized in enterprise. By combining blockchains systems of smart contracts, businesses can take any data-driven human relationship and reduce it to code – guaranteeing accurate and consistent execution of functions which hitherto required human discretion to manage. 

Clearing and settlement, payments and value transfer, and internal audit and accounting are all readily amenable to blockchain automation through smart contracts. 

We’re working with a number of corporations to discuss how our technology can assist their businesses. If you have a query relating to how our solutions can be put to use in your firm, please contact the team at info@erisindustries.com .
