TITLE

Self-operating, serverless, distributed software systems
THELONIOUS - the world’s first smart contract-controlled blockchain

WHAT IS ERIS?

Eris Industries designs and builds enterprise software systems which allow developers to create applications that leverage all of the utility of the modern internet, but without servers. 

Using blockchain technology similar to that of Bitcoin protocol and its many imitators, Eris Industries systems allow the creation of web applications that can be safely, securely, and reliably deployed on the public internet at a substantially reduced cost compared to existing dedicated server or cloud-based solutions. 

Any type of information - whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely tracked and transferred  

WHAT DOES ERIS CONSIST OF?

Eris is a full software stack which includes

the first two components of our open-source developer platform:

Thelonious, the world’s first smart contract-controlled blockchain protocol, and 
	the DeCerver, the world’s first decentralised application server. 

WHY ERIS?

Increasingly complex data-driven relationships between people and business require increasingly complex software design infrastructure. Through the use of blockchain cryptography, Eris Industries simplifies this software design while providing much of the same utility. 

Today, Google-scale infrastructure is required to manage these relationships. Distributed infrastructure, however, can perform these tasks much more efficiently. 

Most importantly, existing alternatives in the market, including Bitcoin, Eris systems do not rely on token monetisation to run and secure themselves from external attack. 

From the user’s perspective, there is no reason that an Eris system should be anything but free to use. From a platform operator’s perspective, it means that blockchain technology can be used in a fully legally-compliant fashion in an enterprise context without needing to worry about many of the financial regulatory hurdles interation with existing blockchain protocols requires.

which require a 'win or die' approach to their design, development, and maintenance. 


ERIS FOR DEVELOPERS

Most blockchains in use today are built to transfer tokens representing monetary value among a network of mutually untrustworthy actors. As such, they are built to be standalone monoliths and their security and consensus models are stagnant and resistant to change. 

Developers deserver a blockchain platform which allows them to benefit from distributed blockchain architecture without being tied to a centralized protocols such as Bitcoin or Ripple. 

This is why we have designed Thelonious: a protocol which is not designed to be one blockchain, but millions of them, each tailor-made by developers for specific contexts. Thelonious allows for the easy and secure deployment of blockchain-absed applications without needing to spend vast sums of money on servers or mining hardware to secure them. 

We have reconfigured the network protocol used by most blockchains so that Thelonious will work within existing enterprise routing and firewall infrastructure, so the platform should be useable by individuals, small businesses, and large enterprises alike.
