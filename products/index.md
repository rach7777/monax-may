# Hosted Chains & Premium Support Package

Developing using a new technological paradigm can be tricky. That’s why we offer the Hosted Chains & Premium Support package to help companies make rapid progress and avoid wasting valuable developer time on setting up environments or getting stuck.

Our hosted chains are cloud-based Eris chains set up and maintained by our team. Clients will have ssh access to the cloud-based instances to allow for custom VPN setup of blockchain instances should it be necessary.

Eris’ Hosted Chains & Premium Support package allows developers to start developing immediately and are great for showcasing early application prototypes internally. Our hosted chains product comes with premium support which includes both chat and email based support.

# Smart Contract Libraries Package

Eris Industries offers subscription level access to the world’s first smart contract libraries focused on specific industries. By providing high-quality, tested smart contract primitives and templates, this will greatly reduce the complexity of creating smart contract applications. For enterprise developers, it will be a matter of simply completing the last-mile configuration.

Our Smart Contract Libraries package will give your organization full access to our smart contract libraries for the purpose of developing proofs-of-concept as well as pilot applications. It will also include all of the services included in the Hosted Chains & Premium Support package Coupled with hosted chains and premium support time-to-market with cutting edge smart contract applications will be dramatically reduced.

This package is the choice if your firm is interested in rapidly prototyping smart contract applications. Eris Industries has been a consistent leader in building modular, pluggable, smart contract libraries within the smart contract communities. And this package gives your firm access to much of that work in highly tested, stable, and usable packaged.

In addition the package includes 10 hours each month where Eris’ core developers for smart contracts will develop modules to be added to the library as requested or built to a specification provided by you. All for an annual price roughly equivalent to what two individual build outs would cost.

# Eris Developer Workshop Program

The Eris Developer Workshop is an immersive 2-day workshop teaching the fundamentals of blockchains, smart contracts and developing applications using the Eris platform. The last part of the workshop involves writing smart contract code. The trainings are offered at the client’s premise and can accommodate up to 15 participants. This workshop is ideal for enterprises who want to gain a competitive edge by building up blockchain and smart contract expertise in-house.

Note: We may start offering public versions of the workshop for companies who would like to train some people, but don’t have a sufficient number of participants to justify purchasing an entire workshop.

# Eris Build-Outs Program

For select clients, we do actual application build-outs in combination with your existing systems integration partner or one of Eris’ existing partner relationships.

These services can include everything from assessing the use case and the business requirements, designing the application architecture, writing the actual smart contract code, to testing and deploying the smart contract applications.

The projects could range from developing proof-of-concepts to explore how smart contracts could be integrated into the enterprise to developing pilot or even production-level systems that will handle real-world data.

Capacity for build-outs is limited and only for pre-selected clients.
