At Eris, our main "product" is our Free and Open Source platform, creatively named: [Eris](/components). That said, we are a for profit company and below our the value add products on top of our FOSS platform that greatly simplify the use of and introduction to smart contract technology in an enterprise context.

# Smart Contract Libraries Package

We offer subscription level access to the world’s first smart contract libraries focused on specific industries. By providing high-quality, tested smart contract primitives and templates, we greatly reduce the complexity of creating smart contract applications. For your developers, it is a matter of simply completing the last-mile configuration.

Our Smart Contract Libraries package will give your organization full access to our smart contract libraries for the purpose of developing proofs-of-concept as well as pilot applications. It will also include premium chat and e-mail based support, meaning your time-to-market with cutting edge smart contract applications will be dramatically reduced.

Additionally, the package includes 10 hours each month where Eris’ core developers for smart contracts will develop modules to be added to the library as requested or built to a specification provided by you. All for an annual price roughly equivalent to what two individual build-outs would cost.

This package is the only choice if your firm is interested in rapidly prototyping smart contract applications. We have been a consistent leader in building modular, pluggable, smart contract libraries within the smart contract community. And this package gives your firm access to much of that work in highly tested, stable, and usable packages.

# Hosted Chains & Premium Support Package

Developing using a new technological paradigm can be tricky. That’s why we offer our Hosted Chains & Premium Support package to help companies make rapid progress, and avoid wasting valuable developer time on setting up environments or getting stuck. Our hosted chains are cloud-based Eris chains set up and maintained by our team.

Eris’ Hosted Chains & Premium Support package allows developers to start developing immediately and is great for showcasing early application prototypes internally. Our hosted chains product comes with premium support which includes both chat and e-mail based support.

If your firm just needs some hand holding while your developers get up to speed with this technology, then this is the package for you.

# Eris Developer Workshop Program

Our Developer Workshop is an immersive, hands on 2-day workshop which teaches your developers the fundamentals of blockchains, smart contracts and developing applications using the Eris platform specifically and smart contract technology generally.

The workshop is offered at your premises and can accommodate up to 15 participants. Feel free to invite your prefered integration partner's developers to fill up the slots!

This workshop is ideal for enterprises who want to gain a competitive edge by building up blockchain and smart contract expertise in-house.

# Eris Build-Outs Program

Eris Industries has already delivered smart contract systems to many of the world's best companies, ranging from bulge bracket banks to insurance conglomerates.

For select clients, we do full application build-outs, either in combination with your existing systems integration partner or one of Eris’ existing partner relationships.

These services can include everything from assessing the use case and the business requirements, to designing the application architecture, to writing smart contract code, to testing and deploying the smart contract applications. Please note that we **do not** offer systems integration or user interface services at all. We are, however, happy to collaborate with your developers or your prefered systems integration partner to provide a cohesive application

The projects could range from developing proofs-of-concept to explore how smart contracts could be integrated into the enterprise, to developing pilot or even production-level systems that will handle real-world data.

Capacity for build-outs is **extremely** limited and only for pre-selected clients.
