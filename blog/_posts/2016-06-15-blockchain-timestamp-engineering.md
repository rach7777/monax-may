# Blockchain, Timestamps and the Art of Legal Engineering

One of the core functions of blockchain technology is the ability to timestamp every transaction, that is, to determine “*who did what when?*” The importance of this underlying proposition for legal applications is fundamental. One of the jobs of a dispute resolution system is to determine who performed what act at what time when relationships break down. The outcome of a legal dispute often turns on such a determination. In the olden days, contracts were made in person and an offer became a contract when the acceptance was received by the offeror. This meant that in a dispute the effective timing of contract was a question of fact for a judge or jury.

Lawyers and judges quickly determined that solving questions of "*who did what when*" via legal fact-finding (judges and juries) was inefficient and added no value to the system if the effective acts could be determined by reliable outside evidence. Additionally, a set of freely available rules based on this evidence would allow parties to predict the outcome of  a result and resolve their own disputes accordingly.

Enter the *mailbox rule*, altering traditional negotiation structure for contracting via post: an offer made by mail is not effective until received by the offeree; acceptance is effective as soon as it is placed in the mailbox by the offeree; for revocation to be effective, it must be received by the offerer before they post a letter of acceptance.

The mailbox rule arose when contract negotiations were often conducted by mail and it was not necessarily possible to determine when the parties had reached mutual assent. Latency, that is, time the contract messages spent in transit, meant that parties might change their minds about critical terms before the elements of a contract were complete. The mailbox rule used the typical elements of postal timestamp, offer and acceptance to determine when a contract was effective.

The mailbox rule, a deviation from existing contract rule, created predictability. Parties could look at the written evidence before them in terms of timestamps and content and determine when and if the elements for contract formation were present. Predictability obviated the need to bring a fact-finder into the process and saved litigation costs.

The mailbox rule, far from being an anachronism of the postal age, scales to electronic commerce. I’ve both won and settled lawsuits involving electronic messages using mailbox rule case law. Blockchain timestamps and an immutable stream of data are more effective than postal stamps and human sworn statements to prove when a legally significant communication took place. Blockchains and smart contracts provide certain evidence of timing and authenticity. The mailbox rule will flex to guide blockchain commerce, even as the latency that necessitated it decreases.

The mailbox rule is a centuries-old example of legal engineering, that is, creation of new rules that build on existing models, evolving them to fit current tools and future relationships. While the need for lawyers to build engineered systems is particularly pressing as we change from one commercial medium to another, the concept of legal engineering is not new. Case law systems, modular statutory code, digest systems, commercial paper, uniform best practices standards and computerized legal research are just a few world-changing and prediction-enabling achievements of legal engineers over the years. Blockchain smart contracts bring new tools to the ancient art of legal engineering and new possibilities for fostering development of commercial and human potential.
