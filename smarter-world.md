TOWARDS A SMARTER WORLD 

Our vision is to build a smarter world - one that comes out to meet the user, not the other way around.  Take for example the process of booking a hotel. Normally a customer would go to that hotel's web site, figure out how to use its specific implementation of a booking system, check if rooms are available, try to book one, enter my details, etc. 

People have tried to make this specific process easier by creating applications which aggregate separate hotel listings into a single platform, and where many sources feed data into a central silo. While this is obviously an improvement from checking them one-by-one, it’s not particularly interesting. A third party service provider still needs to directly interface to each hotel and take its fee. 

There is a difference between Google leveraging the amount of data they collect to provide you with hints of what you might be interested in and an integrated network which allows you to securely and directly transact.  Take, for example, what Google is trying to do with their “Google Now” platform, with predictive analytics that meet the user “halfway”. If I am in a new area, it will suggest “points of interest”. It will show “cards” that suggest the route home to me, if I am not home. It suggests nearby hotels, restaurants, venues and their ratings. This is a step in the right direction, but it is still merely a middle-man - merely a portal. It can’t seamlessly and securely transact on my behalf. But a smart contract-capable blockchain can. 

There will eventually be millions of blockchains in the technology space - all interacting with each other and other database technologies through oracles or other authorized actors. Ordinary users deserve to benefit from the interconnectivity of the web and the security of the blockchain without the security or commercial drawbacks either platform presents today.
