Many blockchains currently deployed are built to be standalone silos, and as such require a 'win or die' approach to their design, development, and maintenance. As a consequence, their security and consensus models are stagnant, and their utility limited. 

In our firm commercial view, "trustless" is a misnomer - and too much of it can be a bad thing. The fact is that even the most ardent user of Bitcoin, the most prominent "trustless" network, extends trust regularly to a certain extent, whether to the banks and exchanges that process USD transfers when they purchase Bitcoin, or to the manufacturers of their computers and operating systems on which they run the Bitcoin client. 

Furthermore, "trustlessness" is multi-directional. It is not necessarily always the case that trust is a pain point for consumers: when dealing with a bank, for example, consumers regularly trust that they will be able to [gain access to deposits]. Failure to satisfy that trust would be and is commercially catastrophic. Where a platform operator can be trusted to administer a platform fairly, 

We at Eris Industries wanted to challenge this idea by designing a blockchain which is not only smart contract enabled, but also smart contract controlled, where trust can be vested in a platform operator

Thelonious, the blockchain design developed by Eris Industries, was not designed to be one blockchain, but rather was designed to be millions of easily deployed blockchains; indeed it complements rather than competes with larger blockchains. Thelonious is able to be interconnected with other blockchains, is able to have its security and consensus parameters change over time, and -- because it is meant to be used by a single corporation or application -- is fast. 

Thelonious is designed to be used by individual customers, small businesses, and large enterprises in equal measure. As such we have reconfigured the network protocol used by most blockchains so that Thelonious will work within existing enterprise routing and firewall infrastructure.

Unlike existing alternatives, Thelonius is purpose-built so that it can easily be deployed to a variety of contexts, from corporate-level deployments to more decentralized and public deployments, or from deployments which require tokenization to those that only require the utility of a blockchain but not monetized tokenization. A single Thelonious client is all that is required in order to participate in all of these blockchains. 

Thelonious is the most agile, usable, and jazzy blockchain design we are aware of. Best of all, on the 17th of December, Thelonious will be fully available for immediate use by developers.
