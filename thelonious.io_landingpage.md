#Design philosophy

##On trustlessness
Many blockchains are built to be standalone silos, and as such require a 'win or die' approach to their design, development, and maintenance. As a consequence, their security and consensus models are stagnant, and their utility limited. 

In our commercial view, "trustless" is a misnomer - and too much of it can be a bad thing. Even for the most ardent regular user of Bitcoin, the most prominent "trustless" network, will extend trust regularly to a certain extent, whether to the banks and exchanges that process USD transfers when they purchase Bitcoin, or to the manufacturers of their computers and operating systems on which they run the Bitcoin client. 

Furthermore, "trustlessness" is multi-directional, and it is not necessarily always the case that trust is a pain point for consumers. When dealing with a bank or a law firm, for example, consumers trust that deposits or funds held on account are safely kept; where these are not, other mechanisms such as insurance or deposit guarantees are available to secure them. When using web-based applications such as social networks and e-mail, they rely on the provider of those services to back up and secure their data. 

Where commercial considerations render the platform operator trustworthy, we see that the question of trust is not between the user and the platform operator - but rather between the user and the platform operator's systems. In such a case, implementing a blockchain-based architecture is capable of enhancing security for the user vis-a-vis both the platform operator (in terms of certainty) and the world (in terms of foiling the efforts of malicious third parties to access that data).

#
We at Eris Industries wanted to challenge this idea by designing a blockchain which is not only smart contract enabled, but also smart contract controlled, where trust can be vested in a platform operator to administer the platform fairly but where blockchain architecture can rationalise both the user-operator relationship as well as the relationships between users themselves. 

#Thelonious

Thelonious is Eris Industries' open-source blockchain design, designed not to be one blockchain, but rather millions of them; it is meant to complement, rather than compete with, its larger, fully-distributed cousins. 

Users are able to set a range of consensus parameters 

Thelonious is able to be interconnected with other blockchains, is able to have its security and consensus parameters change over time, and -- because it is meant to be used by a single corporation or application -- is fast. 

Thelonious is designed to be used by individual customers, small businesses, and large enterprises in equal measure. As such we have reconfigured the network protocol used by most blockchains so that Thelonious will work within existing enterprise routing and firewall infrastructure.

Unlike existing alternatives, Thelonius is purpose-built so that it can easily be deployed to a variety of contexts, from corporate-level deployments to more decentralized and public deployments, or from deployments which require tokenization to those that only require the utility of a blockchain but not monetized tokenization. A single Thelonious client is all that is required in order to participate in all of these blockchains.
