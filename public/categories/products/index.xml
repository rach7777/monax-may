      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to a tweet that landed on my desk today. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Today is the launch of Business for Britain SW &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/forbritain&#34;&gt;@forbritain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/voteleave&#34;&gt;@voteleave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VoteLeaveSW&#34;&gt;@voteleaveSW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Brexit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EURef?src=hash&#34;&gt;#EURef&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/NBcjZ2lpCt&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NBcjZ2lpCt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dr Liam Fox MP (@LiamFoxMP) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LiamFoxMP/status/699222917759049728&#34;&gt;February 15, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business for Britain does not speak for our business in Britain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re headquartered in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of our team is distributed across the European Union/are EU citizens. The functioning of our business as a UK-headquartered company would be substantially impaired if we were cut off from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Four Freedoms&lt;/a&gt; guaranteed by the Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diversity of nationalities is something we see commonly among other startups and among our clients (large corporates that generate a ton of GDP). We suspect they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t benefit from Brexit either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe has marmots. The United Kingdom does not (although in mitigation we should point out that the UK has badgers and hedgehogs). Britons should be free from immigration restrictions to say hello to everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite species of squirrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think Europe is great. All of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are, therefore, adopting the following corporate position with respect to the EU in-out referendum in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Our position on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Brexit&lt;/a&gt; is that the British tech industry will be &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/StrongerIn&#34;&gt;@StrongerIn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetIn?src=hash&#34;&gt;#GetIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Eris Industries (@eris_ltd) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eris_ltd/status/699641234290302977&#34;&gt;February 16, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We forgot to mention this here on the blog when it happened last month, so following &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2016/01/28/pwc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s news about PwC&lt;/a&gt; we figured it&amp;rsquo;d be good to formally announce it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now one-click install a ErisDB, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. etc. chain with Eris on Microsoft Azure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/eris-platform&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here for the Azure quick-start templates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris allows you to do awesome stuff with any blockchain design you like, no vendor lock-in required. Eris on Azure lets you do this quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;One click, a few fields, &amp;amp; boom! A &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&#34;&gt;#bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; node, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ethereum?src=hash&#34;&gt;#ethereum&lt;/a&gt; node, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/IPFSbot&#34;&gt;@IPFSbot&lt;/a&gt; node, &amp;amp; an Eris chain on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Azure&#34;&gt;@Azure&lt;/a&gt; :) &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/iqm2BMoPCY&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iqm2BMoPCY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Casey Kuhlman (@compleatang) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/compleatang/status/685342421429927936&#34;&gt;January 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and, for those of you who are into Bitcoin, not just one Bitcoin. Eris will run &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the Bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of different options for Azure clients are supported and we are continuing to add functionality for new protocols. Per Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/azure-baas-update-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; last month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;(Eris is a) leading platform for industrial applications of smart contract technology. Eris:db blockchains are permissionable, logic optimized blockchains which run EVM compatible blockchains within a permissioned blockchain network. The following templates are in the pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Single validator eris:db blockchain client for rapid prototyping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seven validator eris:db blockchain network for stable demonstration chains spread across user selected Azure data centers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Azure clients will be able to upload the details of their permissioning requirements for the blockchain network in question as part of the instantiation process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, right? We think so too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll keep this short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;We are pleased to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eris_ltd&#34;&gt;@eris_ltd&lt;/a&gt; has been appointed a strategic partner in PwC&amp;#39;s Blockchain solutions portfolio! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PwCFinTech&#34;&gt;@PwCFinTech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Eris Industries (@eris_ltd) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eris_ltd/status/692808595860279296&#34;&gt;January 28, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, we&amp;rsquo;re very pleased about this and looking forward to accomplishing great things in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning about Eris for the first time and want to know what it is? Our partners at Microsoft &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/azure-blockchain-as-a-service-update-4/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sum up the platform pretty well&lt;/a&gt;, so I will just quote them here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eris is a universal blockchain platform capable of running any client for a public blockchain and any client for a permissioned blockchain which is open sourced. The Eris platform greatly reduces the complexity of creating blockchain based applications. Integrate multiple blockchain, distributed file storage, and other distributed systems into a cohesive application. Eris also makes it simple and easy for your organization to get started using permissionable, smart contract capable blockchains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple and easy. And even, dare I say it, fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, or would like to get started using our free, open-source platform today, we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you. Please direct any queries to contact@erisindustries.com in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Release: v0.11</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2016/01/16/v011-release/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost/2016/01/16/v011-release/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/29882791@N02/8300286720/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/monax.jpg&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is with great pleasure that I announce that version 0.11 of &lt;code&gt;eris&lt;/code&gt; is officially released. This version represents a significant upgrade from the 0.10 version of eris in two major areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the pathways and workflow around smart contracts actually exists rather than being a duct-taped and bubble-gummmed pathway no one could work with. Second, we have improved our documentation, tutorials, and perhaps most importantly, our test coverage across the platform tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the focus of our 0.10 release series was on features as we completely redesigned the entire platform between our 0.9 release and our 0.10 release. That complete redesign meant that our entire suite of documentation and tutorials were completely out of date. That has been drastically improved and eris is much easier for new users to get up to speed than it ever has been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a definite tension within software development between wanting to have well tested code and not really knowing what you want the code to look like. When one is designing a platform using relatively new software paradigms, one can waste time spending too much time developing tests. Particularly when you don&amp;rsquo;t even really know &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; to test this new platform because you aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly sure what the platform will look like. This was the tension which we found ourselves in during the devleopment of the 0.10 release sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during the 0.11 sequence we turned our attention away from adding features (with the exception of the smart contracts pathways) and put our attention squarely on testing and stability. And eris is a much stronger tool for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken a look at eris in the past, or if you have had troubles with the complexity required to handle smart contract, permissionable blockchains, take a look again. It&amp;rsquo;s probably easier than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris makes it easy to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run nodes for established blockchains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run middleware which hooks into established blockchins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instantiate new (permissioned) blockchains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build, test, and deploy smart contract packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work easily with IPFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.erisindustries.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt; at the very new and very improved eris! Eris might not be exactly what you thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Licensing: Why Eris is GPLv3</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2015/08/30/on-licensing/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/adulau/3011878917/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/licensing.jpg&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/adulau/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(Photo credit: CC-BY-SA: Alexandre Dulaunoy @ Flickr )&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this weekend Preston and I have spent most of our time reviewing our licensing posture. As we are preparing for future growth of not only our company, but indeed the permissioned smart contract network space generally, it was important to us to make sure that we had released all of our effort using a proper licensing structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting licensing right, for an open source company, is a necessary (if wholly insufficient) component to success of that company. There are a number of considerations to take into account when licensing open source software. Every project is unique, and you should not read this post as advocacy for any particular licensing framework (although we have a soft spot for the venerable GPL licence series), so every project should take into considerations all of its context, get a lawyer, and figure out what is sensible for that project. Basically, this is not legal advice and your mileage may vary depending on your project&amp;rsquo;s goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-set-the-goals&#34;&gt;Step 1: Set The Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;code&gt;goals&lt;/code&gt; we think are the right place to start when thinking through licensing of open source software. At Eris our goals are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make smart contract technology usable for a broad range of developers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work within an ecosystem that makes this technology usable for larger, regulated enterprises;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be as open as we can; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support tooling and infrastructure which is built as free and open software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our goals clearly defined then we moved along to thinking through what we build and the various tensions which bely various open source licences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-understand-the-licences&#34;&gt;Step 2: Understand The Licences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are five &amp;ldquo;major&amp;rdquo; licences for open source software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LGPL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AGPL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;each of which has its own unique characteristics, requirements, and limitations. There have been arguments for, quite literally, decades between these licences; much of that debate (for me) centers around the idea of what is the best way to support the development and maintenance of software which is then given away. For two (now historical) views on this debate please read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/enforcing-gpl.en.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this GPL focused post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/why-apache-defeated-the-gpl-license-developer-freedom-vs-user-freedom/2013/01/21&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this Apache focused post&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those pieces are an excellent read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between these licences usually boils down to one question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;What happens with changes I make to the software?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m greatly summarizing here but the answers to these questions roughly boil down to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. MIT -- who gives a shit
2. Apache -- you can make proprietary changes, sell them, and keep them closed
3. LGPL -- you can make proprietary changes and (sometimes) keep them closed
4. GPL -- you can make proprietary changes and must keep them open if you &amp;quot;distribute&amp;quot; the software
5. APLG -- mostly the same as GPL but if you&#39;re running a web service which uses the licensed software you are &amp;quot;distributing&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one more subtle and important question which appears during licensing discussions, especially in an increasingly open source world where software is built on software is built on software all of which may have various licensing components. This is generally called &amp;ldquo;embedding&amp;rdquo; software. The basic question folks must understand is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;If I use other software to build my software does that affect my ability to license the software?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;*GPL&lt;/code&gt; series is known to have &amp;ldquo;infection&amp;rdquo; properties. This means if your program &amp;ldquo;embeds&amp;rdquo; software which has one of the &lt;code&gt;*GPL&lt;/code&gt; licenses then the &amp;ldquo;whole damn thing&amp;rdquo; is &lt;code&gt;*GPL&lt;/code&gt; licensed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, if your software &amp;ldquo;embeds&amp;rdquo; (also known as &amp;ldquo;imports&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;links&amp;rdquo; in various programming languages) software that is licensed using one of the these licences this will &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; be the result (again, I am generalizing here and this is not legal advice; mileage may vary)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. MIT -- who gives a shit
2. Apache -- no infection, end result can be any licence
3. LGPL -- LGPL infects; all importing or embedding software becomes LGPL
4. GPL -- GPL infects; all importing or embedding software becomes GPL
5. AGPL -- AGPL infects; all importing or embedding software becomes AGPL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embedding used to be an extremely complicated concept with numerous challenges across programming languages. Modern microservices architecture simplifies this to a certain degree simply because there is less need to &amp;ldquo;embed&amp;rdquo; software within other software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3-review-what-other-similar-projects-have-done&#34;&gt;Step 3: Review What Other Similar Projects Have Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in the smart contracts and blockchains business. In our view the closest analogies to the software we&amp;rsquo;re building can be found in the area of databases. So let&amp;rsquo;s look at the licensing structures for various databases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Postgresql&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Proprietary license; similar to MIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mysql&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Commercial licensed with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FOSS exception&lt;/a&gt; to that license that is compatible with a variety of other open source licenses but leans GPL. Mysql has attempted to confine the &amp;ldquo;infection&amp;rdquo; of its code is how I read the FOSS exception. A throwback to its older nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.org/about/licensing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; AGPL license with commercial exception for not open sourced changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/product-licensing/sql-server-2014.aspx#tab=2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microsoft SQL Server&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Proprietary, commercial only licence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBLIC/editions.htm#DBLIC116&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; proprietary licence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are two major components to consider when thinking about a database backend. There is the database itself, surveyed above, but there are also the database drivers and connectors which are used by other programs to connect to the database. Generally, if a programming language wants to be able to have programmatic access to a database it must have a driver available, native to that programming language, which can be used by other programs to talk to the database. Most of the drivers for databases are released with fewer restrictions because it is generally more accepted that simply using the drivers in a validly proprietary piece of software should not infect the whole piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s licensing (which, personally, I think is quite elegant) makes the explicit assumption that its core database is AGPL while the drivers for that database are licensed Apache (presumably, to limit the infection of other, validly proprietary software, which needs to talk to the database). This strikes an elegant balance because rarely, if ever, should a company using MongoDB have to make changes to the MongoDB binary itself. Modern database software does not need as many changes at the core database level as older database technology does for most usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-4-decide-what-works-for-your-project&#34;&gt;Step 4: Decide What Works For Your Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given our approach to blockchaining is not very different that MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s we have taken a similar approach to licensing. For example our eris:db product (a robust server around a permissioned smart contract machine) is licensed GPL3 (more on this in a minute) while our client libraries (which are made to be importable by middleware and browser level javascript suites) are (currently) licenced LGPL. The client libraries &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; move to Apache in order to enable non-disclosure of changes to the client libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question in all software that the licensor must ask themselves is fundamentally, what needs to be changed in this cohesive software project? From our perspective, we hope very little. Our whole goal with the eris stack is to make these systems work in a variety of contexts with very little modification. We, mostly, take a &lt;code&gt;configuration over modification&lt;/code&gt; approach to our blockchain and tooling work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those coming from a world where forking BTC is the start of any blockchain client may not understand this, but for us we have moved so much of the functionality of &amp;ldquo;what you want to do with the blockchain client&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;out of the client itself&lt;/strong&gt; and into different layers, for example the EVM smart contract interpreter, or the genesis permissions options available on the Tendermint blockchain via &lt;code&gt;snatives&lt;/code&gt; contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that very little functionality need to be changed to the eris:db itself, and if those changes were made, the community should be able to take the benefit from it; given that the eris:db binary imports a variety of base libraries with varied licensing; given that we want to make this server be changeable and used for web services without triggering the distribution requirement (it is, fundamentally, a server afterall); given that we default to as open as possible, we have settled on GPLv3 for the eris:db container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;eris&lt;/code&gt; itself we have arrived at the same conclusion albeit with different considerations. Eris is, fundamentally, a convenience wrapper around Docker (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/LICENSE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;as of this writing, licenced Apache&lt;/a&gt;) optimized for blockchain and smart contract applications, we view it as &amp;ldquo;infrastructure tooling&amp;rdquo;. Or, the confluence of two lines of software development we feel should be licenced as openly as possible. Tooling is a bit of a challenge with trying to keep your software open because of the infection principles of GPL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding one must consider some of the history of free software thinking; which means we have to start with someone like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stallman&lt;/a&gt;. For someone who thinks like Stallman licensing would probably break down like this: &lt;code&gt;MIT &amp;lt; Apache &amp;lt; LGPL &amp;lt; GPL &amp;lt; AGPL&lt;/code&gt;. However, many modern open source proponents would reverse those arrows to make the sequencing look like this: &lt;code&gt;MIT &amp;gt; Apache &amp;gt; LGPL &amp;gt; GPL &amp;gt; AGPL&lt;/code&gt;. The difference really boils down to whether you want to &lt;strong&gt;retain the right to enforce that changes to your software be disclosed&lt;/strong&gt;. As explained in the p2p blog post linked to above, for many developers, the second interpretation is better (admittedly, MIT is sometimes left out of that array because of its lack of patent protections) because there is less of a consideration as to the infection and embedding questions. As I said before some of the consideration is technical and, modern, microservice architecture hedges some of the embedding concerns which would be raised by the above as it has generally been settled that talking to a program over an API is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; embedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, at Eris we would lean toward the Stallman approach with the carve out that we think, for the purposes of Eris&amp;rsquo; products, AGPL goes too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We proudly default our products to GPL licences because, for us, it mostly strikes the correct balance of openness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We (Finally) Built Eris!</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2015/08/19/v010-release/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost/2015/08/19/v010-release/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since we officially started working on &amp;ldquo;eris&amp;rdquo;, and we are (finally) ready to move a product we are proud to call &amp;ldquo;eris&amp;rdquo; into beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, version 0.10 of the eris platform is released. Parts of the 0.10 release series have been released (which I mean on stable master branches of the requisite repositories) for a while now. But as of today the centerpiece of the platform going forward, a cli tool we call &lt;code&gt;eris&lt;/code&gt; is &amp;ldquo;released&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 0.10 release of &lt;code&gt;eris&lt;/code&gt; represents a significant step forward for our work. After our &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2015/05/27/v09-release/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;0.9 release&lt;/a&gt; we understood that we needed to completely redesign how the platform operated. Some of the reasons for why this was necessary are included in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.erisindustries.com/documentation/eris-cli/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;platform&amp;rsquo;s Readme&lt;/a&gt; in the Background Section. Other reasons for why this was necessary were included in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2015/08/09/deprecation-warnings/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a blog post about our deprecation warnings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few portions of this release which I would like to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we no longer make an eris blockchain &amp;ndash; permissioned or unpermissioned. We are, however, actively supporting the Tendermint open source project where our permissioned smart contract network efforts have continued. At this point &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;building on eris&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; does not imply that a developer is building on a specific blockchain and &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;eris dapps&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; do not imply that the smart contract network involved be built by any one particular project. In other words, we have gone fully blockchain agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris sits at a layer in the stack between a blockchain client and the operating system. In other words, eris is an &lt;strong&gt;application platform&lt;/strong&gt; it is not a blockchain client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have gone &amp;ldquo;all in&amp;rdquo; on Docker. While some folks have mixed feelings about docker, and while there are still edge cases, it empowers a significant advancement for application developers due to its &amp;ldquo;build once, run the exact same anywhere&amp;rdquo; design structure. One of our alpha testers said about eris, &amp;ldquo;Got a BTC node and an Ethereum node running. Even with the little fiddling, that was FAST!&amp;rdquo; We would not be able to do this without Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With eris, developers and users can simply and easily build and operate smart contract and blockchain backed applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris makes it easy to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run nodes for established blockchains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run middleware which hooks into established blockchins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instantiate new (permissioned) blockchains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build, test, and deploy smart contract packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build, test, and deploy dapps based on the following frameworks:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pyepm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eris-pm (EPM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simple gulp based dapps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work easily with IPFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.erisindustries.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt; at the very new and very improved eris! Eris might not be exactly what you thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deprecation Warnings: What Do They Mean</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2015/08/09/deprecation-warnings/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost/2015/08/09/deprecation-warnings/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have received some incoming communication with respect to the deprecation notices we have placed onto the readme&amp;rsquo;s of Thelonious and Decerver. This is the explanation of what is replacing those repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our permissioned smart contract network (blockchain) design which was called Thelonious has been continued and integrated into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tendermint&lt;/a&gt; project. We have been supporting the Tendermint project by paying one of our Core Developers to work on the Tendermint protocol and blockchain design. Tendermint is a permission-able, proof of stake based blockchain design. More about why we have switched from the old Thelonious design to the new Tendermint design will be forthcoming on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://eng.erisindustries.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Engineering Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decerver, the distributed application server, has more or less been tabled. The idea behind the design was to provide a single server that was able to be plugged into various distributed protocol backends. While the goal was laudable, the implementation was awful. We realized quickly that the implementation conflated API client libraries with a router and http end point framework that a frontend could hook into. Both of these pieces can be, in our estimation, better handled by a series of good node-base client APIs and a node framework such as express. The middleware of an application need not (strictly speaking) be written in node, but we are heading in the direction of fully supporting node. The decerver has officially been replaced with a nice API and client library around the Tendermint blockchain in the form of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eris-db&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-contracts.js&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eris-contracts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPM is being replaced by a combination of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-cli/tree/develop&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eris-cli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-pm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eris-pm&lt;/a&gt;. EPM as a tool became overly bloated and unweidly with three different blockchain designs compiled into the binary and other challenges. The functionality of running, installing, creating, and organizing blockchains is now handled by the eris-cli tool. The smart contract package management functionality of EPM is now handled by eris-pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we are still putting the finishing touches on the 0.10 release and our documentation is not totally where it will be in another month; we are working as quickly as we can to put the pieces of the stack back together for everyone after the major redesign process we have been engaged with over the past three or so months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, even though Decerver, Thelonious, and EPM have been marked for deprecation, if you still would like to play around with that tool chain we are happy to answer any questions you may have via github or our &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.erisindustries.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;support portal&lt;/a&gt;. We are encouraging folks, however, if they are just starting to explore Eris to use the updated stack if they have an ability to work with little documentation or with the older stack if they require a bit more documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of the background as to the overall implementation of the stack and our motivations for this redesign from a platform perspective please &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-cli/tree/develop#why&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
