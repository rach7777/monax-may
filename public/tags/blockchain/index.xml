&lt;h1 id=&#34;enforcing-legal-smart-contracts&#34;&gt;Enforcing Legal Smart Contracts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain smart contracts are a breakthrough development in the quest for a secure, interoperable technology to create data-driven solutions and conduct global commerce. This article outlines a beginning, multi-step framework for smart contract enforceability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchains-for-legally-significant-relationships&#34;&gt;Blockchains for legally significant relationships.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain software architecture combines the security of cryptography with the resilience of distributed networks to create chain of authentic, reliable information about data-driven relationships. This process creates a permanent ledger of transactions that may be viewed by all participants in that particular blockchain system. Blockchains may be configured to suit multiple purposes across multiple verticals, enabling collaborative data solutions. The digital future includes a multitude of blockchain solutions with interoperable smart contracts providing the rules by which data-driven relationships operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchains deliver proof of who did what when, what lawyers call evidence. They add to the legal engineer’s toolbox the groundbreaking element of data certainty, the ability to rely upon the authenticity and chain of title of a document stored in decentralized, cryptographic architecture. This seemingly small feat, proving documentary conditions, consumes a large amount of lawyer time in the form of authentication of records, establishing findings of fact[1] and auditing past events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart contracts are automated, logical, cryptographically secure processes acting on blockchain data. By combining certain evidence and rock-solid audit trail, smart contracts can automate legally significant actions based on if-then/if-else logic, saving significant time and money. They will enable automation of many everyday, business-as-usual commercial processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite enormous potential benefits, stakeholders are unlikely to transfer their valuable business from legacy infrastructure to blockchain systems without firm assurance they are not sacrificing any hard-won existing legal rights in exchange for smart contract efficiency. Legal engineers building blockchain systems must carefully consider the pre-existing judicial precedent and regulatory structures that govern potential use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;judicial-enforcement-of-electronic-contracts&#34;&gt;Judicial enforcement of electronic contracts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common refrain in blockchain industry reporting is a lack of legal standards providing guidance for those who want to deploy a smart contract-based system. From a former law practitioner’s perspective, this perception is generally incorrect. For many use cases, ample authority exists to conceive and build smart contracts within existing legal principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For smart contracts, the existing body of electronic signature and records law provides both enabling and regulatory frameworks that give legal engineers a baseline starting point. Legally significant smart contracts must meet or exceed existing standards for electronic contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic contracts have been vital parts of international commerce and finance since the end of the twentieth century, when many governments enabled electronic contracting through the authorization of electronic signatures.[2]  The e-signature language of the  United States’ Electronic Signatures In Global and National Commerce Act (“E-SIGN”)  contains typical language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) a signature, contract, or other record relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form; and (2) a contract relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because an electronic signature or electronic record was used in its formation.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if the terms of an electronic contract are otherwise binding, an electronically signed contract meets signature requirements, therefore legal obligations may exist in dematerialized, electronic form. Similar rules were adopted by forty-eight U.S. States as part of the model law Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”).[4] Across the globe, jurisdictions wishing to participate in the potential of electronic commerce over the internet enacted laws authorizing e-signatures.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A signature is often a requirement for enforcement of legal contracts, so recognition of e-signatures created the opportunity to transition many kinds of enforceable legal relationships to electronic format. Enforceable e-signatures enabled the creation of many kinds of electronic agreements and the ability to trade them worldwide, including consumer contracts, service agreements and financial instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While e-signature law is largely uniform,there remains a significant degree of variation at the local jurisdictional level as to what agreements still require a traditional, pen-and-paper signature. For example, wills are excluded from most e-signature statutes. Real property records often require signed paper. Local variations are significant but not insurmountable hurdles to automated electronic contracts, underscoring the need for careful examination of specific laws when developing smart contract systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic contracts are increasingly important elements in commerce today. Courts regularly enforce electronic agreements. Dematerialization and interoperability of contracts and instruments is encouraged and mandated by regulatory authorities. The e-signature laws of the turn of the century are updating with more sophisticated tools. The foundation for enforceable blockchain smart contracts is strong and well-placed, ready to support innovative legal models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchain-smart-contracts-are-fit-for-purpose-as-transferable-records&#34;&gt;Blockchain smart contracts are fit for purpose as transferable records&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal engineering inquiry into smart contracts systems does not end at judicial enforceability. Smart contract applications must comply with existing requirements for analogous electronic documents. Specifications and standards for systems that maintain data-driven relationships are produced by multiple actors like governments, regulators and ratings agencies. Read together, they are the framework that allow the transformation of e-contractual obligations into electronic securities and derivatives.  Blockchain smart contract systems can be configured to meet and exceed existing requirements for encryption, data integrity, audit trail and security, trimming operational costs while enabling new revenue models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One foreseeable blockchain application is creation and management of enforceable smart contracts. Enforceable contracts become assets that may be securitized, i.e. treated as collateral, and/or traded.[6] This process is a core function of existing electronic contract systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, E-SIGN and UETA provide similar standards for creation and storage of transferable electronic documents, while other regulations like the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) and securities law provide further guidance for specific collateral types.[7] One initial issue is whether blockchains can meet these statutes’ general requirements that a “single, authoritative copy of the transferable record exists which is unique, identifiable … and authentic.”[8] While it may at first seem counter-intuitive that a system based on a database existing at multiple nodes on a network creates a “single, authoritative copy” of a legal record, blockchain technology both satisfies and exceeds existing standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain smart contracts meet this standard via cryptographically secure content-addressable storage. In a process called hashing, data is passed through complex equations to produce a unique identifier. The hashing process is one-way, meaning no two sets of data produce the same outcome, and it is infeasible to decipher the hash to reveal the contents without a key. The distributed ledger provides the requisite immutability and audit trail.This combination produces the unique record of provenance, authority and control required by existing law, exceeding the capabilities of prior technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology fills the express needs for better electronic contract solutions. Both E-SIGN and UETA  avoid making specific technological recommendations in order to encourage further innovation. UETA notes in comments to the 1999 model law that the statute&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I]s designed to allow for the development of systems which will provide “control” as defined in Section 16. Such control is necessary as a substitute for the idea of possession which undergirds negotiable instrument law. The technology has yet to be developed which will allow for the possession of a unique electronic token embodying the rights associated with a negotiable promissory note. Section 16’s concept of control is intended as a substitute for possession.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jurisdictions are encouraging the use of blockchain technology to meet commercial data needs. As of this writing, the Vermont house is considering a bill that, among other things, treats blockchain documents as self-authenticating.[10] Delaware has launched an initiative to use blockchains in many registry functions.[11] U.S. federal authorities are considering explicit enabling of blockchain through legislation.[12] Globally, this phenomenon is reflected in the many nations exploring blockchain solutions for government and commercial purpose. Blockchain smart contracts are are well-suited to bridge the gaps in worldwide data driven relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;integrating-blockchains-and-legal-smart-contracts-old-questions-new-tools&#34;&gt;Integrating blockchains and legal smart contracts &amp;ndash; old questions, new tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing body of electronic contracts law gives a firm foundation to the first step in creating automated legal contracts: dual integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal in drafting legal smart contracts is predictability of rules-based results that allow businesses to create reliable future plans and products.[13] Traditionally, contracts may be made in any medium, including oral agreement. Enforcing oral agreements requires testimony of humans, an expensive and unpredictable process. Written contracts eliminate much of the uncertainty about enforcing a contract, because the terms are created at the time the contract is signed, not recreated from witness memory. The higher degree of reliability of paper writing led lawyers to develop a way to ensure that a contract means what it says and that it will be enforced as written: the integrated agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An integrated written agreement embodies the entirety of the parties’ contract. If a contract is fully integrated, evidence that would contradict or vary the terms of the written document is inadmissible, and a court is limited to the contract document in determining the intent of the parties.[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drafted properly, fully-integrated contracts may be proved solely by documentary evidence &amp;ndash; no testimony of humans other than document authentication is required or allowed.[15] Well-drafted contracts contemplate potential disputes and provide evidence for managing those disputes as simply as possible. Cumulative lessons of potential outcomes become boilerplate, the fine print that addresses as many “what-ifs” as possible. A tightly-drafted, fully-integrated contract has no loopholes in its performance and prevents time and money wasted on enforcement. It has a high degree of predictability in its outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure enforceability of legal relationships made in in blockchain data relationships, the simplest first step is to combine an integrated, enforceable contract with smart contract functions via dual integration. Dual integration links smart contracts and full legal contracts by reference to the contract’s storage address on the blockchain. Incorporating documents and objects by reference in legal documents is a familiar process to lawyers and delivers baseline enforceability industrial applications will demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart contracts can deliver today the reliability of existing e-contract procedures. Meeting existing standards enables us to iterate more complex smart contracts over time, creating safer, transparent assets, creating efficiency and liberating dark data. While Eris Industries is building increasingly automated legal contracts, since the company’s inception we have recommended dual integration as a reliable, scalable way to build enforceable smart contracts.[16]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;self-enforcing-smart-contracts-the-future-of-legal-engineering&#34;&gt;Self-enforcing smart contracts: the future of legal engineering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due diligence of dual integration accomplished, legal engineers are free to explore the next frontier of smart contracts: self-enforcing contracts. Enforceability means the right to apply to an actor with authority over the contracting parties to force the breaching party to pay or act. One limitation of self-enforcing smart contracts is scope: smart contracts can only enforce agreements to the extent that assets are known and held within the blockchain system itself. Currently, a legal smart contract must be coupled with judicial legal enforceability in order to be useful. Absent legal enforceability, if a contracting party breaches an agreement, she may simply avoid liability by not placing value into the system against which a promise may be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is foreseeable that there will be many situations where on-chain enforcement is a viable and desirable tool, for example, in cases where collateral is held in blockchain form, where disputes are primarily documentary, and for purposes of broader cross-collateralization.[17]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-enforcing smart contracts, because of the variability in contracting procedures at local levels, are not yet amenable to a one-size fits all framework. Lawyers have long deconstructed deals and severed them into multiple, modular documents based on function. In order to create self-enforcing contracts, it is necessary for law-trained minds to deconstruct legal systems, actors, identities, property, governments, money and relationships. After deconstruction, legal engineers examine points in legal processes that may be augmented and automated through the application of smart contracts. In a legal process this means looking for objects, functions and deterministic, if-then/if-else logic to identify processes that can benefit from cryptographic data certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the legal engineer’s undertaking is tremendous, but it is proportional to the commercial value of automated contract provisions, decisions, and actions. The ability to apply logical legal processes to evidence using smart contracts opens the door to more complex legal agreements limited only by ability to define fact patterns and affect assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;fact-patterns-predictions-and-building-decentralized-organizations&#34;&gt;Fact Patterns, Predictions and Building Decentralized Organizations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a noisy one in the smart contracts world. The ambitious early Ethereum project, The DAO, blew up overnight as token holders found their accounts drained by a hacker. The DAO was the first large, for profit, decentralized autonomous organization deployed on Ethereum’s public blockchain, attracting more than $150 million worth of ether investment in its crowdsale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response of in the blockchain community has been a mixture of shock and “I told you so,” especially from lawyers. In smartcontractland, lawyers generally opined that The DAO iteration was too unstable for deployment and said so noisily in blogs and social media. The developers saw a bug, well in advance of release. The lawyers saw a different problem: the DAO loudly eschewed risk management because of the self-executing nature of smart contract code. Lawyers warned that risks for participants in the event of failure ranged from losing their investments to enormous civil liability and possibly jail. Undaunted, the DAO deployed anyway. Here be dragons indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers predicted the organization’s implosion based on their knowledge of &lt;em&gt;fact patterns&lt;/em&gt;, that is, the tendency of human relationships to repeat, in cause-and-effect succession, recorded over centuries by the legal system. Common law attorneys learn primarily by studying fact patterns of prior relationship failure to recognize recipes for disaster and avert course accordingly. Fact patterns allow lawyers to distance ourselves from the human stories that might otherewise cloud our analysis and judgment so we can make clearer decisions. In The DAO’s case, red flags were obvious: unlicensed actors in regulated space, refusal to plan for what might happen in the event of a failure and lack of testing. Lawyers also calmly accept that you just can’t convince some people, and the law will be there to both clean up the mess and tell us how to avoid the same problems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it didn’t have to be this way, with a little attention to risk management and legal engineering. The same fact patterns that informed lawyers’ prediction of problems with The DAO give us models on which to build, to experiment, to push the limits of blockchain relationships. Risk management and legal engineering allow us to plan how we build according to the succession rules of “what might go wrong?” In legalese, it&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;em&gt;foreseeablility&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since inception, Eris has led the way on decentralized organization development. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that made me want to be a marmot, the company&amp;rsquo;s clear-eyed view on &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; do DAO and its vision of the huge potential of DAO done right. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://prestonbyrne.com/2016/05/17/thedao-dont-walk-away-restructure/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Preston Byrne wrote recently&lt;/a&gt;, the blockchain decentralized organization model is worth fixing. Despite manifest risk, people around the globe poured money into The DAO project, demonstrating the traction of cryptographic code-based organizations bringing global actors together to achieve a purpose. The time for decentralized organizations is here. The DAO debacle is a testament to the crucial need to get corporate governance right and a test of the governance of Ethereum as a whole as it weighs its response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is not an “I told you so,” rather, it is an exploration of the value of the fact pattern in both making predictions and building stuff for human use. The DAO fact pattern reinforces these law school lessons: 1) blockchains, like all human undertakings, are not special snowflakes; and 2) the best way to change the law is to learn its rules and carefully direct their evolution, use case by use case. To build new models that humans use, we must study, and learn from, human fact patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;blockchain-timestamps-and-the-art-of-legal-engineering&#34;&gt;Blockchain, Timestamps and the Art of Legal Engineering&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core functions of blockchain technology is the ability to timestamp every transaction, that is, to determine “*who did what when?*” The importance of this underlying proposition for legal applications is fundamental. One of the jobs of a dispute resolution system is to determine who performed what act at what time when relationships break down. The outcome of a legal dispute often turns on such a determination. In the olden days, contracts were made in person and an offer became a contract when the acceptance was received by the offeror. This meant that in a dispute the effective timing of contract was a question of fact for a judge or jury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers and judges quickly determined that solving questions of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;who did what when&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; via legal fact-finding (judges and juries) was inefficient and added no value to the system if the effective acts could be determined by reliable outside evidence. Additionally, a set of freely available rules based on this evidence would allow parties to predict the outcome of  a result and resolve their own disputes accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the &lt;em&gt;mailbox rule&lt;/em&gt;, altering traditional negotiation structure for contracting via post: an offer made by mail is not effective until received by the offeree; acceptance is effective as soon as it is placed in the mailbox by the offeree; for revocation to be effective, it must be received by the offerer before they post a letter of acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mailbox rule arose when contract negotiations were often conducted by mail and it was not necessarily possible to determine when the parties had reached mutual assent. Latency, that is, time the contract messages spent in transit, meant that parties might change their minds about critical terms before the elements of a contract were complete. The mailbox rule used the typical elements of postal timestamp, offer and acceptance to determine when a contract was effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mailbox rule, a deviation from existing contract rule, created predictability. Parties could look at the written evidence before them in terms of timestamps and content and determine when and if the elements for contract formation were present. Predictability obviated the need to bring a fact-finder into the process and saved litigation costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mailbox rule, far from being an anachronism of the postal age, scales to electronic commerce. I’ve both won and settled lawsuits involving electronic messages using mailbox rule case law. Blockchain timestamps and an immutable stream of data are more effective than postal stamps and human sworn statements to prove when a legally significant communication took place. Blockchains and smart contracts provide certain evidence of timing and authenticity. The mailbox rule will flex to guide blockchain commerce, even as the latency that necessitated it decreases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mailbox rule is a centuries-old example of legal engineering, that is, creation of new rules that build on existing models, evolving them to fit current tools and future relationships. While the need for lawyers to build engineered systems is particularly pressing as we change from one commercial medium to another, the concept of legal engineering is not new. Case law systems, modular statutory code, digest systems, commercial paper, uniform best practices standards and computerized legal research are just a few world-changing and prediction-enabling achievements of legal engineers over the years. Blockchain smart contracts bring new tools to the ancient art of legal engineering and new possibilities for fostering development of commercial and human potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;blockchain-legal-engineering&#34;&gt;Blockchain Legal Engineering&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal engineering ensures that information gets to the right place at the right time. Technology accelerates the speed of legal engineering by providing ever more reliable and complex models for managing legally significant information and events. Legal technology puts pressure on lawyers to innovate. In &lt;em&gt;The End of Law&lt;/em&gt;, Richard Susskind gives his formula for winning the legal technology contest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set the bar of difficulty on your work so high that others are dissuaded from competing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid bespoke work by creating packages that have value and that may be customized for specialized needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once innovative packages get integrated into the marketplace, they become a commodity, a fungible item for which marketing is necessary to extract value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To succeed, legal innovators must continually create new, top-notch packages that lead the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no resting on one’s laurels in legal engineering. Successful legal tech  needs a team with energy, drive, vision, creativity and smarts to keep ahead of imitators who will inevitably create a commodity out of one’s innovative product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enter the Eris marmots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Eris, we believe that the mechanism to allow smart contract technology to blossom into a thriving multichain environment is legal engineering, providing a system for distribution of verifiable knowledge when and where it is needed. Legal engineers use knowledge of human systems to build new models for people and their relationships with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools: Data Certainty and Legal Models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart contracts add to the legal engineer’s toolbox the novel element of &lt;em&gt;data certainty&lt;/em&gt;, the ability to trust the authenticity and provenance of a document stored in decentralized, cryptographic architecture. This seemingly small event, proving data certainty of documentary conditions, consumes a large amount of lawyer and compliance team time. Authentication of documentary conditions is the “low hanging fruit” of smart contract development and a necessary step to managing more complex relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perfect the blockchain data certainty model, it is critical to start with the simplest legally effective documents: commercial paper. Commercial paper is a complex system based on promises and documentary conditions. Commercial paper law provides the elements of settlement finality, fungibility and protection against adverse claims, all of which blockchain engineers work hard to achieve. Settlement finality means that once a financial transaction occurs, it cannot be undone because of problems with the underlying transaction. Fungibility means one unit of value is the same as another and can be traded, apples-to-apples, like money. Adverse claims protection means that abiding by commercial paper best practices protects against multiple promises to pay secured by the same collateral, analogous to the bitcoin double-spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pre-baked commercial paper elements are the rails that will allow chains to interact and are the the focus of Eris’s early endeavors. To build a new ecosystem, we have to get the “paper” right, empowering synergistic growth on top of a stable foundation. With reliable financial models in place, participants will be free to begin building new relationships based on shared participation in blockchain commerce, creating a proliferation of chains and business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris’s legal engineers will be right there, leading the way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legal Entity Global Ledger - How to liberate public data (with chains)</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2016/04/08/lei-global-ledger/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One of the key aspects of Blockchain / Distributed Ledger (DL) Technology is the ability to merge public key authentication of information with a resilient, distributed database. In this piece, which outlines an application Eris is building, I talk about this idea in greater detail using publicly available data from the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of news, blog posts, and whitepapers foreshadowing the disruption of entire industries by &lt;em&gt;blockchains&lt;/em&gt; and describing a myriad of potential use cases that will run more efficiently on a decentralized architecture. What is striking is that almost all prominently discussed topics focus on processes and scenarios with a fair amount of complexity and/or attempt to replace very established procedures. At first, this seems logical since the potential for efficiency gains usually increases with the complexity of the use case, but it seems we&amp;rsquo;re rushing too far ahead and have forgotten about one fundamental formula that has always proven helpful when venturing into new territory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Start small, learn what works and what doesn&#39;t, and build up from there
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We at Eris Industries are very much about &amp;ldquo;less talking, more doing&amp;rdquo; as subscribers to our blogs and Twitter account can surely attest. So, in this article I would like to hone in on a &amp;lsquo;real world&amp;rsquo; use case that exemplifies what can be done with blockchains &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt;.
It is very understandable that people may feel they should wait and gain more experience and confidence with this fairly new technology before investing much effort into it. Even when investments (usually in the form of POCs or in-house / consortia experimentation) are made, many might hesitate to build and deploy &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; solutions on shared ledgers until potentially a &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;winner&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; emerges, be that a blockchain design or a common industry platform. However, I would like to show here that the technological components are mature enough, especially in Open Source, to extract value and start building &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Transformational ROI from blockchain for corporates will take a good number of years. Smaller bits of ROI can be achieved tomorrow if you have the right buy in and strategy and partners.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sytaylor.net/2015/11/21/10-things-you-should-know-about-blockchains&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Simon Taylor, Nov. 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When carefully selecting use cases, opportunity opens up to implement something &lt;strong&gt;beyond POCs&lt;/strong&gt; that contributes to the learning experience at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blockchains are a new type of hammer that can hit new nails. We don’t fully understand what the new nails look like yet, so let’s keep hitting old nails until we understand the new hammer. So it makes sense to apply this technology to well understood problems, even if they can be solved using existing technology.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bitsonblocks.net/2016/04/04/what-you-get-for-free-with-blockchains/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Antony Lewis, April 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchains by design come with a set of features that is desirable in most (enterprise) applications, even if it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; to reduce operational expenses for hosting, failover, or disaster recovery. The availability of blockchain platforms and toolkits further reduces costs of building custom solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, shall we dive into a discovery and selection process of what we should build?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, in order to increase the chances of arriving at a level of production-readiness let&amp;rsquo;s avoid any of the big &lt;em&gt;unresolved&lt;/em&gt; challenges of blockchains/DLT, namely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Transaction Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidential Transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-User Identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the number of participants profiting from a blockchain solution should be as high as possible, after all it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; ledger. As detailed by Gideon Greenspan in articles from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/10/private-blockchains-shared-databases&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;October&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/avoiding-pointless-blockchain-project-gideon-greenspan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;November&lt;/a&gt; of last year, blockchain technology as a shared writable data store has private as well as public utility, but the &lt;strong&gt;public domain&lt;/strong&gt; should be considered as a category that trumps most other checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, to be mindful of the &lt;em&gt;start small, build up&lt;/em&gt; mantra it should be our goal to identify a simple use case upon which more complex scenarios can be built. This means we&amp;rsquo;re looking for low complexity in the &lt;code&gt;business processes at a network level&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. a small number of interactions between disparate entities in a low-trust environment, yet delivering value through the shared content. Two pillars underpinning many higher level business processes are &lt;strong&gt;Master Data Management&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Reference Data Management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado &amp;hellip; meet the candidate to be &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;ledgerized&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-legal-entity-identifier-lei&#34;&gt;The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;LEI data is freely available, easy to access, without restrictions on redistribution or licensing. [&amp;hellip;] Future phases will require a new &amp;lsquo;utility strength&amp;rsquo; global infrastructure, which will have similar robustness, reliability, and business continuity capabilities as other financial market infrastructures, such as securities settlement systems and trade repositories.&amp;rdquo;
From the original &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sifma.org/uploadedfiles/issues/technology_and_operations/legal_entity_identifier/lei-preliminary-scope-plan.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2012 scope plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEI initiative emerged out of a request by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.g20.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;G20&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fsb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 to establish a globally unique identifier for legal entities, primarily to increase transparency of their involvement in global financial transactions (something that could&amp;rsquo;ve doubtlessly been of value when sifting through the mess of a global meltdown of the financial system, but let&amp;rsquo;s not get into that &amp;hellip;).
The LEI system as it exists today operates in three tiers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory Oversight Committee (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leiroc.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LEI ROC&lt;/a&gt;), comprised of more than 50 regulatory institutions worldwide and a variety of public sector stakeholders, monitors the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gleif.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GLEIF&lt;/a&gt;) is in charge of governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local Operating Units (LOUs) are accredited agencies that function as the beachhead in local jurisdictions / countries to render services around the LEI, e.g. issuing LEIs to local businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly a few facts about the LEI system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is an LOU&amp;rsquo;s primary responsibility to certify that the information about a company (legal name, registered address, headquarters address, entity status, etc.) is valid and current. To do so it sometimes relies on services of third-party companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.avoxdata.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Avox&lt;/a&gt; (a subsidiary of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dtcc.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DTCC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmeiutility.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GMEI Utility&lt;/a&gt; operated by the DTCC in collaboration with SWIFT is by far the largest such LOU in terms of issued LEIs (see diagram below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An LEI record possesses a lifecycle that goes through different state changes (active|not_active, current|not_current, etc.) and also expires if not renewed. This lifecycle is supported by a simple business process / workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOUs, third-party verifiers, and legal entities themselves participate in this workflow. For example, a company can register, update, or dispute their own data (which still requires verification or approval by the LOU) or request the LOU to do so on their behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The LEI format is based on ISO Standard 17442 and follows Financial Stability Board (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fsb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt;) specifications. The LEI consists of a 20-digit alphanumeric code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/LEI-Issuer-Statistics-GLEIF.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}
&lt;div style=&#34;font-size: smaller; text-align: center&#34;&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/global-lei-index/lei-statistics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/global-lei-index/lei-statistics&lt;/a&gt;, 28-Mar-2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the certified issuance agencies (LOUs) in the above list owns, runs, and maintains its own infrastructure (servers, web application, and centralized database) to offer LEI issuance and search capabilities. The delta of changes at an individual local agency is uploaded and consolidated into the global &amp;ldquo;golden copy&amp;rdquo; that is managed by the GLEIF as depicted in the following diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/LEI-current.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of running and maintaining the LEI infrastructure is probably not very high compared to solutions with higher transactional volume. The individual LOUs cover parts of their costs by charging fees for registration and other maintenance transactions. As of this writing the combined fees for registering a new LEI are approximately $220 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEI system went live in 2014, the same year &lt;code&gt;blockchain&lt;/code&gt; as a general concept separated from Bitcoin and entered the spotlight. It is an intriguing thought experiment - now that the capabilities of blockchains are more widely discussed - what this system would look like had it been implemented on a distributed, participatory architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s look at this scenario in more detail and examine the stages of implementing the LEI system as a global shared ledger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-lei-global-ledger&#34;&gt;The LEI Global Ledger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its early days, Eris Industries has been advocating the utility of a blockchain as a &lt;strong&gt;data management tool&lt;/strong&gt; with unique properties: It stores both its &lt;code&gt;state &amp;amp; transition logic&lt;/code&gt; (simply put, it houses the data records including the rules that govern them, i.e. authority to access and change as well as the legality of changes). Furthermore, a blockchain distinguishes itself from previously known distributed database approaches by not having a central owner or administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain therefore allows us to store and share a single version of the &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; about the state of all LEI data as well as encode and enforce the validity of changes to this data via smart contract logic. All while the infrastructure is jointly operated by its network participants.
&lt;a name=&#34;permissioned&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;permissioned-blockchains-and-ownership&#34;&gt;Permissioned blockchains and ownership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point it is important to take a detour and explain why this particular use case requires what is known as a &lt;em&gt;permissioned&lt;/em&gt; blockchain which necessarily introduces a level of control and ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control&lt;/strong&gt; is expressed in the permissioning layer which authorizes peers to connect to the network in different roles. For example, the group of peers responsible for validating transactions and coming to consensus on the global state of the system should be configurable as a white list of known actors. The same applies to the peers specifically allowed to commit changes to the ledger; every node on the network with &amp;lsquo;write access&amp;rsquo; to the ledger needs to be identifiable and associated with a known participant, for example, a local issuing agency (LOU). However, due to the public nature of the data, read access should not be restricted at all and anyone should be allowed to connect a &amp;lsquo;read-only&amp;rsquo; peer. This approach of &lt;code&gt;permissioned &#39;write&#39; and public &#39;read&#39;&lt;/code&gt; is sometimes also referred to as &lt;em&gt;hybrid&lt;/em&gt; blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt; needs to be established in the form of a trusted entity to:
a) guarantee the availability of the network, e.g. by running the minimum number of nodes required to keep the system available
b) function as the trusted custodian of the smart contract logic (including versioning and updates) and provide legal liability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that many shared ledger solutions, especially the ones touching upon the public domain, are going to require a certain form of centralized control to maintain and version the ledger software itself as well as the smart contract code running on it. For different use cases one can imagine non-profit or publicly funded organizations, governments, municipalities, etc. to assume such responsibilities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the financial realm there already are a number of organizations that are well positioned to fulfill the role of becoming future shepherds of decentralized, distributed infrastructure and the programs running on this infrastructure: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fsb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sifma.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SIFMA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.isda.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ISDA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dtcc.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DTCC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swift.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SWIFT&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip; to name a few.
Other sectors, such as healthcare, have similar umbrella organizations and for many other use cases that are going to be identified as potential distributed, shared ledger applications the local or federal government might be the default candidate to play the role of the &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;trusted custodian&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Or will we create &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DAO&lt;/a&gt;s for this? If Bitcoin has taught us one thing: Creating a blockchain protocol appears to be easier than governing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his 2015 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/wmougayar/blockchain-2015-analyzing-the-blockchain-in-financial-services&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; William Mougayar stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blockchain and old constructs, such as clearing houses and private exchange networks (SWIFT, CCP, FIX, DTCC) are like oil and water: they will not mix well because one is based on centrally trusted intermediaries, and the other is based on ‘no’ intermediaries and peer-to-peer trust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reference to the points made above, I respectfully beg to differ and recent publications appear to confirm that organizations like the DTCC are beginning to open up to the exact same ideas outlined in this article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;DTCC’s viewpoint is that basic industry master data is an ideal candidate for improvement using decentralized consensus, rule standardization and auditable change history. This information is used by the entire industry by definition, and the lack of consistency and quality is a recurrent industry problem. Further, this could be constructed in such a manner that multiple firms can be authorized as data submitters, there can be many data validators and the majority of users will be data consumers.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/PDFs/DTCC-Embracing-Disruption.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DTCC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Embracing Disruption&amp;rsquo;, Jan. 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s get back to the LEI ledger implementation &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;architecture-overview&#34;&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram below outlines the components of a single peer node of such a network built using the Eris Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/LEI-Node-Architecture.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/business/2016/04/03/wtf-is-eris/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Eris Platform&lt;/a&gt; is a free and open source (FOSS) platform that facilitates building, testing, and running smart contract applications. It supports the notion of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/advanced/services-making/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;service&lt;/a&gt; as a single module that can be started, stopped, and monitored easily. The LEI application and the parts comprising a peer node participating in the LEI Global Ledger network are wrapped inside such a service.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://erisindustries.com/components/erisdb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Eris:DB&lt;/a&gt; is the permissioned blockchain implementation (see &lt;a href=&#34;#permissioned&#34;&gt;Permissioned Blockchains&lt;/a&gt; above) based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ethereum.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; Virtual Machine for smart contract execution and &lt;a href=&#34;http://tendermint.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tendermint&lt;/a&gt; for efficient, non-forking &lt;a href=&#34;http://tendermint.com/posts/tendermint-vs-pbft/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PBFT&lt;/a&gt; consensus. The application consists of a number of service modules facilitating the interaction with the LEI blockchain, i.e. providing access to data on the chain as well as allowing the application to react to events in the network. Furthermore, a distributed data store is used to redundantly store the entire legal entity record. Note that the smart contract only contains the LEI itself, the data fields used in the smart contract logic, as well as the reference hash to the stored record. All legal entity data is also kept in a traditional database that functions as a cache and is kept in sync with the state registered in the blockchain. This supports the ability to index and search the content.
Essentially, this application (in its intended final state) would behave the same way and provide the same services as the GLEIF&amp;rsquo;s global search capacity combined with an LOU&amp;rsquo;s registration and maintenance capability (if the peer owner has been permissioned with a write access role!), but running distributed on all nodes of the network instead of a centralized server. &amp;hellip; Good bye backups, fail-over, and disaster recovery! You&amp;rsquo;re welcome DevOps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections outline the stages that can enhance and eventually transform the existing LEI system to a distributed ledger. Stages 1-3 are designed to be completely non-disruptive to the current LEI system. During these stages the LEI Global Ledger is operated in parallel to the existing infrastructure with increasing effort and inclusion of participants. This allows interested parties to share in the experience of a live blockchain application with real data; all with a minimal investment and no risk. Stage 4 (and beyond) requires definite buy-in and sponsorship by the stakeholders of the LEI eco-system due to the declared intention to eventually replace the current centralized infrastructure with a distributed, blockchain-based one.
&lt;a name=&#34;stage1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stage-1&#34;&gt;Stage 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global LEI data is freely available for download and an update is published daily. In this first stage there is no buy-in or support from any participant in the existing system. Eris Industries is responsible for downloading the daily updates and cryptographically signing the transactions that push these updates into the LEI ledger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/LEI-Net-Phase-1.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate effect for any consumer operating a &amp;lsquo;read-only&amp;rsquo; peer is that access to LEI data is changed from a &lt;em&gt;pull&lt;/em&gt; to a &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt; mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stage has been implemented by Eris Industries! Please see the &lt;a href=&#34;#getinvolved&#34;&gt;end of the article&lt;/a&gt; for instructions how to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stage-2&#34;&gt;Stage 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stage 2 an entity with authorized access to the global LEI database would assume responsibility for vouching for the data veracity by signing transactions to commit updates to the ledger. The GLEIF seems to be in a perfect position to do so. The transition to this stage is as easy as hooking up a few database triggers to capture update/insert events and forward these to the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/LEI-Net-Phase-2.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stage-3&#34;&gt;Stage 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same mechanism of hooking into a database as described in stage 2 is leveraged here, but it would be the LOUs themselves that propagate data into the blockchain and the central synchronization point at the global GLEIF database can be removed. With this stage we&amp;rsquo;re closing in on the LEI ledger allowing a near real time view of the LEI records as events get reported to the ledger much closer to their points of origin. At any time the LEI ledger would provide a more accurate view of the entire system than the daily consolidated file download can provide. A beneficial side effect of the LOUs cryptographically signing their own data commits is that they become identifiable via their signatures in the ledger&amp;rsquo;s audit trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/LEI-Net-Phase-3.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stage-4&#34;&gt;Stage 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming a successful exploration and validation of the LEI ledger in stages 1-3, a blockchain-based LEI system might be deemed feasible and worthwhile considering as a full replacement of the centralized infrastructure.
However, before the latter can simply be switched off, there is some effort involved to implement and test the integration points to any centralized systems that would remain in place and now need to interact with the ledger&amp;rsquo;s API.
At the end of stage 4, all core participants of the LEI lifecycle would be fully onboarded to participate in the smart-contract-backed workflow purely through signed transactions. Known participants include all LOUs and, if applicable, third-party data verification services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/LEI-Net-Phase-4.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;beyond-stage-4&#34;&gt;Beyond Stage 4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential future enhancements to the system beyond stage 4 include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal entities participating directly in the workflow, verifying the correctness and signing off on their own data for renewal. This would require a more common and pervasive use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). It is not very difficult to foresee that a company having gone through a verification process to prove its identity might want to register more than the legal address in the LEI ledger, e.g. their public keys. Quite sophisticated B2B processes can be built from there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another thought experiment involves the possibility to introduce free market economic principles into the system and open up the fee collection to competition. A legal entity could simply post a registration request with a certain fee associated as a reward that can be claimed by a third party for rendering services successfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last one is admittedly a bit far-fetched and has legal implications that cannot easily be solved with a smart contract alone (yet), so let&amp;rsquo;s leave it at this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be realistic &amp;hellip; the existing LEI system works sufficiently well, so why would you even want to attempt to replace it? &amp;ldquo;Because we can&amp;rdquo; is not an answer that will convince any of the stakeholders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main motivation for writing this post was to get people that are interested in blockchains, smart contracts, and distributed applications thinking. To show what&amp;rsquo;s possible and that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait years to build something meaningful, something that provides value to a large audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I was able to demonstrate the viability of transforming an existing system like the LEI from a number of loosely joined, centralized data islands to a shared distributed ledger / smart contract application. All with very minimal investment and low to no risk in the early stages. A chance for people to experience a real blockchain application first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking that there is a risk of &amp;ldquo;blockchain (or vendor) lock-in&amp;rdquo;. However, running the proposed solution side-by-side with the existing LEI system eliminates any risk (for the time being) of betting on the wrong blockchain. Even if at a later time a different blockchain implementation becomes more suitable, one of the benefits of this design is that control is introduced via trusted custodians who have the authority to perform a data migration by recommitting all historical transactions to a new ledger, albeit the original transaction timestamps would likely get replaced. Downstream systems would experience minimal to no disruption as long as a standardized data format is adhered to (e.g. the LEI system defines an XML Schema specification).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the benefits of maintaining a globally unique registry, like the LEI, on a shared distributed ledger as a single source of truth can be proven and established, then it is not difficult to repeat the same for data with similar characteristics, e.g. the &lt;em&gt;Unique Product Identifier&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.isda.org/functional-areas/technology-infrastructure/data-and-reporting/identifiers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UPI&lt;/a&gt;). The success of such initiatives would unlock more sophisticated use cases that require a deeper involvement of existing market participants: how about *&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Actions* reporting and validation&lt;/strong&gt; on a shared ledger?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verifiable public data in a trusted, distributed, participatory infrastructure can foster open innovation and unlock future use cases. Replacing existing (centrally run and controlled) services with distributed, community-supported ones would allow public, private, and especially governmental institutions to &amp;ldquo;outsorce&amp;rdquo; IT infrastructure to their own communities or citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where individuals, businesses and governments are constantly locked in a battle against bugs, fraud and malicious actors, blockchains propose an alternative. […] The paradigm shift blockchains represent can offer true data integrity, advanced digital identity systems and a new way for business to offer transparency for audit alongside access for third parties.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/123460713/how-blockchains-are-redefining-cyber-security&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ben Rossi, Dec. 2015&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&#34;getinvolved&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember&lt;/strong&gt;: Eris Industries already built the LEI Global Ledger as depicted in the &lt;a href=&#34;#stage1&#34;&gt;Stage 1 diagram&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;rsquo;re intending to voluntarily run this network for the time being, so that others get a chance to experience what a distributed, smart-contract-enabled solution feels like.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this use case and its implementation, e.g. if you&amp;rsquo;d like to experiment with a read-only peer node or want to develop a business case out of this solution, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact Eris Industries via &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:contact@erisindustries.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or Twitter handle &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eris_ltd&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@eris_ltd&lt;/a&gt;. Please voice your opinion (good or bad) and feedback on this article by tweeting it with the hashtag &lt;code&gt;#leiledger&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to collect requests by interested parties and intend to make the &lt;code&gt;LEI Net Service&lt;/code&gt; available as part of one of the next Eris platform releases.
The smart contracts controlling the LEI lifecycle and workflow can be used as the basis to implement similar data repositories. They are being made available to subscribers of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://erisindustries.com/products/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eris Contracts Library&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Public Science: A Slightly More Practical Guide</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2016/03/15/chains-and-science-how-to/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost/2016/03/15/chains-and-science-how-to/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is Part 2 in a probably several part series. &lt;a href=&#34;https://db.erisindustries.com/science/2016/03/14/blockchains-and-science/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous post was stricly a think-piece. Here, I outline some practical steps that a consortium of institutions could take to provide the basic building blocks needed to acheive a worldwide ledger of knowledge. The problem is this: how do we maximize the quantity of data (that has sufficient quality) in order to acheive scientific consensus on some topic of study? Most of what is proposed here is realistic today although several ideas will need significant refining before any practical implementation succeeds. A summary at the end distinguishes the possible from the now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step would be for a group of educational/research institutions to form a consortium. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a solution as to how this ought to play out; suffice to say the minimum requirement would be the desire to reduce reliance on publishers for publishing research. Each institution would be a validator on publicly accessible blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a chain in tow, step two would be for them all to run many &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipfs.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; nodes to ensure persistent availability of data (shameless plug: &lt;code&gt;eris services start ipfs&lt;/code&gt;). Crucially, we want the validator nodes and IPFS nodes running on the respective hardware of these institutions. Indeed, as public institutions, it ought to be their mandate to ensure access to knowledge for generations to come without reliance on cloud hosting providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, for a specific field of research, some basic standards need to be agreed upon. These standards form the basis of what one might call smart contract factories. Roughly, three steps must be appropriately defined. Think of each as a smart contract which, once executed, allows the next steps to &amp;ldquo;be open&amp;rdquo; for execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, for a nugget of scientific knowledge to be considered valid (i.e., &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;, as subjective as that may be), there should be consensus on the following standards:
a) pre-registering experiment,
b) acceptable data for said experiment and,
c) analysis of total (and ongoing! see Note, below) data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each step has some requirements. In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For b) we need specific standards for validating data from external sources (other labs, and, importantly, the public). That is, compatibility with crowd-sourced data/user-generated content should be the default. By having a) occur publicly, the opportunity for both: 1) feeback to refine the initial methodology and 2) anybody to propose experiments is available (which, with a proper content value sorting system would easily filter out pointless experiments). Finally, once the data are gathered, discussion and subsequent consensus on a scientific conclusion for the data set can be acheived, in a public forum (and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; behind closed-doors &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; anonymous as the current status quo certainly is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: because there is a specific framework in place for accepting valid data for some pre-registered experiment, new data can be added to the set in perpetuity. Consequently, the conclusion derived from what is essentially a single experiment can evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this look like in practice? Well, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://db.erisindustries.com/science/2016/03/14/blockchains-and-science/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; we have Alice and Bob. If Alice had announced, &lt;em&gt;ahead of time&lt;/em&gt; her intentions to attempt the groundbreaking experiment, then perhaps Bob could have contributed both: a) improvements to the methodology and, b) valid data by running the experiment himself. Both Alice and Bob would now each have a shared data set, thus increasing statistical power. In the previous post, neither Alice or Bob concluded anything groundbreak from their data. Perhaps the data set simply wasn&amp;rsquo;t large enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps tackle the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4550299/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;increasingly problematic lack of reproducibility in psychological science&lt;/a&gt; and maybe, just maybe, the conclusion that &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;most research findings are false&lt;/a&gt; can be un-concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Alice proposes the experiment and Bob suggests improvements, perhaps Charlie sees that it&amp;rsquo;s a great idea and happens to have a research laboratory five times the size; ideal for running such experiments at scale. Even better, let&amp;rsquo;s say the experiment is simple enough to run in the average &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-it-yourself_biology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DIYbio&lt;/a&gt; lab and a data set orders of magnitude that was ever thought possible can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is collected and, eventually, analysed. Since the data is added in real-time and all the details of the ongoing experiment are available publicly, &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can run a statistical analysis and propose an interpretation. Again, creative content filtering schemes will be needed to ensure that the cream rises to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this different from the average research collaboration today in academia? Usually, collaborations are &lt;em&gt;ad-hoc&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., planned and all the roles divided up ahead of time. My proposal has collaboration happenening &lt;em&gt;post-hoc&lt;/em&gt; (once an experiment is proposed for pre-registration) and completely fluid, provided participants are generating useful content (data, if you will).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge, as I&amp;rsquo;ve repeatedly alluded to, is having creative and well-implement reputation and reward schemes. Reasearchers need to somehow be compensated for their time and receive credit where credit is due. If this basic requirement can be satisfied then I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful we&amp;rsquo;ll see science accelerate its effeciency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, we need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) a consortium of institutions,
2) running many IPFS nodes and,
3) acting as validators on a chain,
4) their researchers to publish planned experiments ahead of time (pre-registration),
5) data standards such that adding to the set is seamless and verifiable,
6) creative way of acheiving consensus on conclusions from analysis of data set,
6) a sane on-chain indexing method,
7) a meaningful user interface to pull it all together and, finally,
8) useful solutions to reputation/compensation problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1-4 is, at a minimum, do-able today, as is a portion of (5), most of (6) and probably (7). As far as I can tell, enough pieces of the puzzle are in place to start implementing some of these basic features as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blockchains For Science: Aligning Research Incentives</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2016/03/14/blockchains-and-science/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost/2016/03/14/blockchains-and-science/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note: This post originally appeared as &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-blockchains-can-further-public-science-1457972964&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;How Blockchains Can Further Public Science&lt;/a&gt; in Bitcoin Magazine. It is maintained here for archival purposes. Eventually, it&amp;rsquo;ll all be on IPFS. &lt;a href=&#34;https://db.erisindustries.com//science/2016/03/15/chains-and-science-how-to/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Part 2 is now available&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that had me most excited about Bitcoin back in 2013 was its potential to re-align the incentives in academia and re-define how science and research is conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was spending my days training rats in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skinner boxes&lt;/a&gt; to hunt crickets, listening to every possible Bitcoin explainer I could get my hands on. It took a good two years, and now the problem set is much clearer. This post a think-piece on how academia might be improved with blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what follows, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the problems that perturbed me the most and highlight potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taught in every Research Methods 101 course, the file-drawer problem – more generally referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;publication bias&lt;/a&gt; – does perhaps the most disservice to the scientific community at large. Allow me to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice is a researcher in cell biology. One night she dreams up an idea for a potentially groundbreaking experiment. Alice does the experiment, but does not get the result she expected. Alice tweaks a few parameters and tries again. Again, the result doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit her hypothesis. She eventually abandons this &amp;ldquo;groundbreaking&amp;rdquo; idea and moves on to other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob is also a cell biology researcher. Independently of Alice – but after reading much of the same literature – Bob dreams up a similar &amp;ldquo;groundbreaking&amp;rdquo; experiment. After many tries, Bob also fails to get the expected result. Bob moves on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the problem here? Bob duplicated Alice&amp;rsquo;s efforts. Why? Alice&amp;rsquo;s efforts were not accessible to Bob; instead, they were siloed away under &amp;ldquo;things-that-don&amp;rsquo;t-work&amp;rdquo; on her hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Alice and Bob have Internet. From a technical point of view, it should be really easy for Bob to access all the experiments Alice tried. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply: incentives. Publishing a &amp;ldquo;non-result&amp;rdquo; in a &amp;ldquo;third-tier&amp;rdquo; journal won&amp;rsquo;t advance Alice&amp;rsquo;s career the way a &amp;ldquo;significant&amp;rdquo; result in, say, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; will. Writing up the article and going through the submission process probably won&amp;rsquo;t happen because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cT_Ulmcrys&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;nobody has time for that&lt;/a&gt;. Even though science advances mostly when we discover &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/a&gt;; most of what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, isn&amp;rsquo;t known. Instead, everything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work is locked up in that researchers&amp;rsquo; file drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice could very well publish her results informally on her blog, or to a handful of journals (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Plos ONE&lt;/a&gt;) that don&amp;rsquo;t use statistical significance as a metric for publication (but still charge hefty publication fees). Although things are changing, this is far from the norm. And, as far as I could tell from 5 years in academia, the scale of duplicate work across labs around the world is both unknowable and likely enormous. It isn&amp;rsquo;t time consuming for these data to be published, but I suspect many academics don&amp;rsquo;t feel it is worth their time, or that the contribution isn&amp;rsquo;t meaningful enough if it isn&amp;rsquo;t in a prestigious journal, or that it won&amp;rsquo;t be archived and indexed properly. Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is known is that it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concepts of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cos.io/prereg/?utm_source=Open+Science+Framework+General&amp;amp;utm_campaign=9bbf63c095-OFFICIAL_11th_OSF_Message1_5_2016&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pre-registering experiments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://thewinnower.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;widening the scope of acceptable citations&lt;/a&gt; begin to address this issue and will likely reap enormous benefits across academia. (I&amp;rsquo;ll have more to say on this in the future with respect to smart contract factories for experiments). However, the challenge – assuming we want this knowledge free, distributed, and easily accessible (forever) to anyone with an Internet connection – is archiving and indexing all the content such that our assumption is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sci-Hub&lt;/a&gt; (see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/a-pirate-bay-for-science&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Robin Hood of Science&lt;/a&gt; for the an excellent review) is promising in that it provides free access to vast stores of human knowledge; knowledge otherwise inaccessible if &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/elsevier-acts-against-research-article-pirate-sites-and-claims-irreparable-harm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Elsevier had their way&lt;/a&gt;. But this solution is not distributed and, as far as I can tell, offers no permanent archival solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the InterPlanetary File System: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipfs.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; has emerged as the most likely candidate for long-term knowledge preservation. Using (among other future-proofing features) content-based addressing (a hash) rather than location-based addressing (a URL), reliance on central servers is all but eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And IPFS definitely plays nice with blockchains. Enter indexing. We need a registry to both track the hashes of all relevant content and update them. Ideally, such a registry would be shared across many educational institutions, which would be validators on a permissioned consortium blockchain. This strikes me as a likely direction for such institutions that are having to re-invent themselves in the digital age. Indeed, they should be the ones retaining the intellectual property of the researcher, not for-profit journals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the underlying motivation behind the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/toadserver&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;toadserver&lt;/a&gt;). It takes an uploaded file, gets its IPFS hash, registers the file name and hash in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eris:db&lt;/a&gt; name registry and finally, adds the file to n IPFS nodes. It&amp;rsquo;s really just a glorified database, but with write permissions across stakeholders who might not fully trust each other. This is all well and good, though it&amp;rsquo;s not going to revolutionize science overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another failing of academic research is its inability to effectively incorporate user-generated content. As a student of animal behavior, I watch in awe at the scientifically interesting (and relevant) discussion about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2jpal5/trick_your_cat_with_a_circle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tricking your cat into a circle&lt;/a&gt; and wonder how to parse this content into useful data that might lead to a scientifically sound conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the public has a thirst to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/scienceamaseries&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;understand – and participate in – scientific inquiry&lt;/a&gt;; a thirst left wholly unquenched by mainstream academia. Publishers that charge 40 bucks per article aren&amp;rsquo;t helping either. A big challenge – likely solved by creative incentive/reputation schemes – is compensating researchers for their time. That discussion is probably too early to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, how can we aggregate useful user-generated content to improve the throughput of scientific research? The current focus of using a blockchain to streamline financial services is fine, but let&amp;rsquo;s talk about automating knowledge discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When first dreaming up chain-based apps, one idea in particular stuck with me. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Population dynamics&lt;/a&gt; – the study of geographical distribution of life on earth i.e., analyzing &amp;ldquo;where life is&amp;rdquo; – is both a logistical nightmare and labor intensive. Roughly: 1) get a research grant, 2) hire some graduate students, 3) gather data (field work), and 4) analyze &amp;amp; publish the data. The problem: 1) is time-consuming and ultra-competitive, 2) is fairly easy, 3) is time-consuming, as is 4) since it&amp;rsquo;s rarely outsourced and the raw data is usually siloed away anyway. Five years later, the research team has a conclusion about ant diversity in one small region of Africa. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Science is incremental indeed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Google &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/google-opens-its-cloud-vision-api-to-all-developers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;released to the public&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/vision/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Vision API&lt;/a&gt;, a nifty set of tools for analyzing images. For example, if you send it a picture of what is clearly a marmot, the API will return a response with the description &amp;ldquo;marmot&amp;rdquo; and a match score (i.e., degree of certainty that the image is, in fact, a marmot). What happens when you combine this functionality with a blockchain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, the submission of content (well, images) that meet specific parameters (quality is in the eye of the beholder) can be incentivized. That is, the content can be checked for its purported authenticity before being added to a shared database for subsequent analysis. For example, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://marmots.org/observer-program/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marmot Recovery Foundation&amp;rsquo;s Observer Program&lt;/a&gt; could have a mobile app that allows users to submit geo-tagged images of marmots to be used for analysis in exchange for tokens – tokens redeemable for marmot merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the budding school-aged scientist of the future will spend his days traipsing through the woods, taking pictures of ants, classifying them and adding everything to a chain run by a consortium of colleges and universities. The better the classifications he submits, the more tokens he earns – tokens redeemable at any of the participating institutions as tuition, for example. Applications like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifescanner.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LifeScanner app&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://m.plantnet-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PlantNet&lt;/a&gt; get us closer to such a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough talk. About a week ago, I put together the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/marmot&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marmot Checker&lt;/a&gt;, which is another piece of the puzzle in terms of automating knowledge generation throughput. Briefly, an image is uploaded, processed, and sent to the Google Cloud Vision API to get descriptions of the image; these descriptions are checked against a user-defined list of words, and if there is a match, the image is added to the toadserver. Although the implementation is quite is simple, a few hundred lines more of code and you&amp;rsquo;d have, say, a smart contract that sends the submitter of matched content some amount of tokens as a function of the match score and/or the users&amp;rsquo; reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, this is part a growing set of tools for the scientific community. Already we&amp;rsquo;re seeing more and more startups building tools to streamline the collaboration workflow process between research laboratories.   That won&amp;rsquo;t cut it so long as the data is siloed within research labs/groups, journals are pay-per-view for the public and the average citizen hasn&amp;rsquo;t the means or method to contribute meaningfully to global shared knowledge. After all, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;citizen science&lt;/a&gt; really be called science proper? With blockchains I think it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fight for open access to knowledge has been an ongoing battle – a battle that ultimately took &lt;a href=&#34;http://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/the-robin-hood-of-science-the-missing-chapter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Aaron Swartz&amp;rsquo;s life&lt;/a&gt; while simultaneously stalling the progress of humanity and lining the pockets of shareholders. All this to protect copyright yet in clear violation of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Univerisal Declaration of Human Rights Article 27&lt;/a&gt; which states that &amp;ldquo;everyone has the right freely to &amp;hellip; share in scientific advancement and its benefits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is ultimately a public endeavor, and making that dream a reality now appears possible with blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://db.erisindustries.com//science/2016/03/15/chains-and-science-how-to/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; for slightly more practical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Eris and Tendermint: Application and Consensus</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2016/03/02/eris-and-tendermint/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;At Eris and Tendermint, we&amp;rsquo;re often asked: &amp;ldquo;what is the difference between Eris and Tendermint?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from being two different companies and two different products, the simple answer boils down to application and consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris:db is the application layer for blockchain applications. It&amp;rsquo;s the backbone for deploying and interacting with your application logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tendermint is the consensus layer. It&amp;rsquo;s the engine that drives your application, once built, forward in time and keeps it in synch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an application layer, Eris:db has opinions about what a blockchain should look like. As a consensus layer, tendermint has opinions about how the consensus should operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much like the difference between Wordpress (a content management platform) and Apache (a web server); Wordpress is an application platform that has opinions about how to tie together PHP/node &amp;amp; MySQL. Apache is a web server that has opinions about, well, doing what servers do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some developers build custom applications with Wordpress. Indeed, Wordpress makes it easy &lt;em&gt;by making assumptions for you&lt;/em&gt;. Others might not like these assumptions and thus build applications from scratch that talk directly to Apache. Don&amp;rsquo;t like Apache? Use Nginx with Wordpress instead. Don&amp;rsquo;t like Wordpress? Go and use Liferay or Zotonic. As separate modules, the developer has choice and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/eris-tendermint.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, the analogy&amp;rsquo;s not a perfect one - in our view, a content management system such as Wordpress is really more like &lt;a href=&#34;https://erisindustries.com/components/erisdb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eris:db&lt;/a&gt;, whereas &lt;a href=&#34;https://erisindustries.com/components/eriscli/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eris:cli&lt;/a&gt; is a more comprehensive blockchain application and database management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where, in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t already noticed, eris is all-in on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;. In the future, this will allow eris:db to plug into any type of consensus. Additionally, eris:cli should simplify the workflow of developing a Tendermint chain &lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; eris:db, over &lt;a href=&#34;http://tendermint.com/posts/tendermint-socket-protocol/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tmsp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of looking at it might be the difference between an empty toolbox and a Swiss Army Knife. Tendermint gives you a really nice toolbox. You can take this box and put whatever you want in it, and the box will keep your &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl17CYYSzUw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; together and let you get on with the business of building your useful application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris, by contrast, gives you a ready-to-go Swiss Army knife with plenty of useful tools and services (including BigChainDB, ZCash, Bitcoin, Ethereum, OpenBazaar, Tendermint, and ErisDB). Some you might not want, so don&amp;rsquo;t use them. If you want new ones added, take off the baseplate and add the new tool. And since eris:db may not suit your purposes, building a chain that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-by-example/blob/master/erisdb_tmsp/run.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;talks directly to Tendermint core over tmsp&lt;/a&gt; might be what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, eris:cli is intended to make running both eris:db and Tendermint simple. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t, please take to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eris_ltd&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and tell us what you&amp;rsquo;d like to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made these design decisions because &lt;a href=&#34;http://cointelegraph.com/news/proof-of-work-proof-of-stake-and-the-consensus-debate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;proof-of-work consensus makes zero sense&lt;/a&gt; for enterprise blockchain applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;marmots-and-mint&#34;&gt;Marmots and mint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/marmots-and-mint.jpg&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris Industries&amp;rsquo; relationship with Tendermint started shortly after we released our Alpha product in December of 2014 (thelonious/decerver), where we&amp;rsquo;d forked Ethereum, ripped the guts out of its consensus and replaced it with a bunch of smart contracts in order to create Eris:DB&amp;rsquo;s predecessor - a design that was, the first (and for about six months, the only) permissioned blockchain in existence. Those of you who have been following the company for some time will remember we initially called it &amp;ldquo;Thelonious.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a fork of an existing proof-of-work design was not going to cut it for us. So Ethan went searching for an alternative and about two months later, he stumbled on Tendermint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus. With Proof-of-Stake.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Awesome,&amp;rdquo; thought Ethan. Shortly thereafter Eris Industries and Tendermint began collaborating on the Tendermint codebase and, over the next few months, &lt;a href=&#34;https://erisindustries.com/components/erisdb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eris:db&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;towards-modularity&#34;&gt;Towards modularity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intimately linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tendermint consensus&lt;/a&gt;, eris:db has a handful of application state features which reside over and above the consensus layer. This lack of modularity is certainly not ideal, as Casey elaborates &lt;a href=&#34;https://eng.erisindustries.com/explainers/2015/12/31/on-blockchain-clients-in-2016/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so we began working to refactor Tendermint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we didn&amp;rsquo;t know it, things were heading this way for awhile. It was a particularly memorable night in Tel-Aviv during marmot dev retreat this past fall where Ethan laid it all out for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the tips of his fingers the very next day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://eng.erisindustries.com/explainers/2016/02/22/apps-and-consensus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Applications and Consensus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tl;dr (though you should definitely read it!) for the above is: Two separate processes. Two separate states. Choose your application. Choose your consensus. And because consensus is at a lower level, it is perhaps (in some cases - not others) more important to get right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s through that lens that we announce today, with mixed emotion, that Ethan will be leaving Eris to co-found Tendermint as CTO. Much like the codebase is being refactored, so are the companies. And we&amp;rsquo;ll certainly be crossing paths again. Indeed, we&amp;rsquo;ve known each other for 5 years, lived together for 3, worked in the same research lab, and have pretty much been shooting the intellectual shit since we first met. And after I dropped out of grad school (because, you know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru-Z5kvd9js&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; ), he taught me how to code. Bitcoin is cool, no doubt (decentralized money and all), but when it comes down to it, the most exciting aspect of this technology is a plurality of chains with a plurality of consensus&amp;rsquo;. And the ongoing refactor (see again &lt;a href=&#34;https://eng.erisindustries.com/explainers/2016/02/22/apps-and-consensus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;On Applications and Consensus&lt;/a&gt;) will help achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this ongoing transition has been a looming burden on several of us, I&amp;rsquo;m actually quite excited for what the future will bring. Even more so following the week Ethan and I spent in San Francisco with Jae and Dustin prior to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theblockchainconference.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Block Chain Conference&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed at length the distinctions described in this post which should, moving forward, clarify the entrypoint for both developers and business folk looking to build out blockchain applications. I&amp;rsquo;ll offer another analogy: Eris is a mechanic shop (read: Formula 1 pitstop) with most parts of the car built for you and Tendermint is the manufacturer of Ferrari engines. There you have it: application and consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift towards seperation of the application and consensus will likely reap many benefits for the crypto ecosystem as a whole. The Bitcoin community is starting to realize this. In the words of &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@muneeb/forking-a-network-86d1b766d38d#.a5k2kajx3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Muneeb Ali&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
We’ll need to cleanly separate consensus-breaking code from non-consensus breaking code and have formal methods to verify implementations against protocol specifications.

&lt;p&gt;So what does this look like from a technical perspective? Bear with us as the design considerations are being fleshed out. Pictured below is an early conceptual overview of how we view the interaction between the various components. We&amp;rsquo;ll have more to say about this in the coming months. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/eris-chains-overview.png&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this fit in with the various components of the stack you already know and love? Awhile back I &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cerebralbosons/status/682691657473503233&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; a first pass on visualizing the stack as a whole. Here&amp;rsquo;s v2 with a few little additions. With all the moving pieces involved, it ought to be clear why docker is the right choice, despite the pain points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much will change on the UX of eris:cli, other than additional modularity when it comes to consensus, i.e., ability to &amp;ldquo;plug into&amp;rdquo; whichever consensus you&amp;rsquo;d like. This&amp;rsquo;ll allow for much greater experimentation moving forward, as we &amp;ldquo;transition from first-generation blockchain tech to second-generation blockchain tech&amp;rdquo; to paraphrase IBM&amp;rsquo;s John Wolpert keynote from the conference mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marmots are excited. Are you?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eris CLI Tool Walkabout: Services</title>

&lt;p&gt;{% include series.html %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;services-as-a-service&#34;&gt;Services as a Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Services are what you, as a developer, stitch together to build an application. They are the glue that holds everything together, run in docker containers, and can be built on top of other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want a blockchain to manage and automate an army of 3d printers. Your service, call it &lt;code&gt;three-dee-printing&lt;/code&gt;, might index CAD files as IPFS objects, each with a bitcoin address and price. A tendermint chain listening for (valid - i.e., paid in full) transactions to those bitcoin addresses could initiate printing by pulling the CAD image from IPFS and adding the print job to the queue. Users could upload any CAD file to your service to get a quote, after which it would be added to the index. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much left for you to do other than ensure your printers are running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service definition file for &lt;code&gt;three-dee-printing&lt;/code&gt; would have this extra line:&lt;/p&gt;
[services]
dependencies = [&#34;ipfs&#34;, &#34;btcd&#34;, &#34;chainName&#34;]

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;chainName&lt;/code&gt; is itself a chain running as a service. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s that easy. Of course, the bulk of the work goes into making contracts for your chain to manage the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Alice operates an army of delivery drones in the warehouse next door. She could have a service that has &lt;code&gt;three-dee-printing&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency and listens for transactions where the user has requested and paid for drone delivery. From order to delivery, services can do it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a neat example. What&amp;rsquo;s your service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-cli/tree/develop#install-eris&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Install Eris CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-cli/tree/develop#services&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run&lt;/p&gt;
eris init

&lt;p&gt;to grab some default service definition files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out which services are available&lt;/p&gt;
eris services known

&lt;p&gt;Launch a service&lt;/p&gt;
eris services start [name]

&lt;p&gt;Docker will do its thing and voila! Your service is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirm this is the case&lt;/p&gt;
eris services ls

&lt;p&gt;Run a Bitcoin node: &lt;code&gt;btcd&lt;/code&gt;, or an ethereum node &lt;code&gt;eth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more about IPFS as a service &lt;a href=&#34;https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/08/05/ipfs-as-a-service/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a service can also spawn a data container if &lt;code&gt;data_container = true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-cli/tree/develop#data&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information about &lt;code&gt;eris data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protip: Running too many services at once might crash you operating system: kill a service&lt;/p&gt;
eris services stop [name]

&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; flags to get rid of the data containers and containers, respectively. When things really get bloated, run&lt;/p&gt;
docker rm -v -f $(docker ps -a -q)

&lt;p&gt;but be careful with this command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to OSX users - save yourself a lot of headache by working on a remote box or use Kitematic.&lt;/p&gt;
