      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Being a lawyer-led company, Eris Industries has a bunch of legal knowledge in-house - more so than most software companies. As such, we&amp;rsquo;re quick to form opinions about policy matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/13/david-cameron-encrypted-messaging-apps-ban&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;very early opposition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/2015/11/02/IPBill/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#IPBill&lt;/a&gt; eighteen months ago to our pro-remain position on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2016/02/16/getin/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#Brexit&lt;/a&gt;, we take public positions on policy matters early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally we have thoughts on the EU membership referendum which occurred last week. You may have noticed that the people of the United Kingdom voted &amp;ldquo;Leave.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-tremendous-disappointment-for-british-business&#34;&gt;A tremendous disappointment for British business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way you look at the &amp;ldquo;Leave&amp;rdquo; vote, it is a huge disappointment for British business. Two years ago, Eris Industries had three employees who worked out of our homes. Today, we have 17, with our head office remaining for the moment in London, an office in Berlin, and a subsidiary operating from New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are Europeans. Our team is French, Italian, Belgian, German, Swiss, English and Scottish. (American, Canadian, and South African, too.) We simply could not have assembled this team, and grown as we have, without the UK being a member of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect wailing and gnashing of teeth on this issue across London and the UK over the coming weeks and months. Because the British people chose this outcome, denial is not productive. Nor is it a choice. As democrats we must accept that we are dealing with an exit from the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can mitigate. British and global companies can, and should, start considering our options and work towards adopting a common position. In Eris Industries&amp;rsquo; view, far and away the best option on the table is what the Adam Smith Institute calls the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/time-for-the-eea-option&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EEA Option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-we-support-the-eeaoption&#34;&gt;Why we support the #EEAOption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EEA option de-risks Brexit. It allows British business to thrive, and allows European and global business to deal with the whole of Europe - and the wider world - from their current bases in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very sound business reasons to support this positon. As an information-age startup with a distributed workforce, when we started up in the UK, the UK&amp;rsquo;s membership of the single market made it easy for us to expand our operations on the continent with very little hassle. It&amp;rsquo;s always hard to find the right people. However, being able to hire in Germany, Belgium, and elsewhere meant we always managed to get our hands on the right candidates to help our business grow and expand into the world-leading blockchain technology provider we are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We and our employees benefit from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.polipedia.eu/tiki-index.php?page=Four+Freedoms+of+the+European+Union&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the four freedoms&lt;/a&gt;, especially those of free movement of labour and capital. If these freedoms are taken away, new, innovative businesses that follow in our footsteps will be hamstrung by stricter immigration restrictions, tax regulations, and compliance obligations, as well as reduced availability of investor funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom of movement is really the most critical piece. With it we can hire the best people Europe has to offer, and deploy them where we need them, when we need them, for as long as we need them to be there. Without it, our compliance costs would go up and we simply wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to get the right talent - because there simply isn&amp;rsquo;t enough of it concentrated in any one place in the European Economic Area. This includes London, which (as anyone in tech will tell you) is simply not the hub of global tech talent it fancies itself to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you see, Brexiteers, freedom of movement is not merely about holidays in the south of France or a shorter queue at the UK border. To be blunt, &lt;strong&gt;without freedom of movement in the EU/EEA, British firms cannot compete effectively in global markets.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK&amp;rsquo;s talent pool has proven far too small for our requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our conclusion is that the only compromise option that ticks the boxes in terms of business’ interests – from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free movement of labour, to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the single passport for financial services, to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tariff-free trade with the EU,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is also palatable from the perspective of the Brexiters and the much-beloved Scots, is the EEA Option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-others-should-support-the-eea-option&#34;&gt;Why others should support the EEA Option&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore support the EEA Option &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adamsmith.org/evolution-not-revolution&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(full paper here)&lt;/a&gt;, emphatically. We would encourage others to do the same, for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson, Daniel Hannan, and Douglas Carswell – all free marketeers, each of whom are likely to have some say in what the outcome of the Brexit discussions are – have all hinted (or, in Carswell and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/eu-referendum-tory-campaigner-admits-brexit-immigration-some-control-a7102626.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hannan’s case&lt;/a&gt;, expressly stated) that continued membership in the single market is desirable. This is an entirely sensible and prudent position to hold and is in the interests of British business. We should let them know we support this position, which will substantially mitigate the damage of Brexit to British business, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 48-52 defeat is not a mandate to withdraw from all trade relations with the EU and “go it alone” – the so-called “WTO Option” – but rather it is only a mandate to leave the EU. We owe it to the majority to leave, but they owe it to the (very large) minority to concede some middle ground. Compromise is hard, but needed, considering &lt;strong&gt;any exit will operate to unilaterally strip 16 million (!) British citizens, and British businesses, of EU citizenship and the rights and freedoms we currently enjoy and do not wish to surrender.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;British business must avoid hand-wringing and advocate in favour of settlement on the UK&amp;rsquo;s future status &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; quickly. As in today, as in right now. An “investment strike” is already underway. Deals are being abandoned, orders are being cancelled. Some of my former colleagues in the City have told me firsthand accounts of how their dealflow is drying up on account of #Brexit. Overcoming political paralysis to make a rapid decision in this direction will promote financial stability, inward investment, and London’s continued position as a financial services and innovation centre. Every day that there is delay will do further damage to this position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This - investment strike - is what matters , not £ or FTSE.  Longer we faff around, worse it will be. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/EaPclJCp04&#34;&gt;https://t.co/EaPclJCp04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jonathan Portes (@jdportes) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jdportes/status/747146000385572864&#34;&gt;June 26, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are therefore getting behind the #EEAOption and encourage the rest of British industry - tech, banking or otherwise - to get behind it immediately, vocally, and forcefully. We also recommend supporting and engaging with the think-tank community and their advocacy work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sincerely hope you will join us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to a tweet that landed on my desk today. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Today is the launch of Business for Britain SW &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/forbritain&#34;&gt;@forbritain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/voteleave&#34;&gt;@voteleave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VoteLeaveSW&#34;&gt;@voteleaveSW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Brexit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EURef?src=hash&#34;&gt;#EURef&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/NBcjZ2lpCt&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NBcjZ2lpCt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dr Liam Fox MP (@LiamFoxMP) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LiamFoxMP/status/699222917759049728&#34;&gt;February 15, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business for Britain does not speak for our business in Britain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re headquartered in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of our team is distributed across the European Union/are EU citizens. The functioning of our business as a UK-headquartered company would be substantially impaired if we were cut off from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Four Freedoms&lt;/a&gt; guaranteed by the Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diversity of nationalities is something we see commonly among other startups and among our clients (large corporates that generate a ton of GDP). We suspect they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t benefit from Brexit either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe has marmots. The United Kingdom does not (although in mitigation we should point out that the UK has badgers and hedgehogs). Britons should be free from immigration restrictions to say hello to everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite species of squirrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think Europe is great. All of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are, therefore, adopting the following corporate position with respect to the EU in-out referendum in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Our position on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Brexit&lt;/a&gt; is that the British tech industry will be &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/StrongerIn&#34;&gt;@StrongerIn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetIn?src=hash&#34;&gt;#GetIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Eris Industries (@eris_ltd) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eris_ltd/status/699641234290302977&#34;&gt;February 16, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We forgot to mention this here on the blog when it happened last month, so following &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2016/01/28/pwc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s news about PwC&lt;/a&gt; we figured it&amp;rsquo;d be good to formally announce it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now one-click install a ErisDB, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. etc. chain with Eris on Microsoft Azure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/eris-platform&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here for the Azure quick-start templates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris allows you to do awesome stuff with any blockchain design you like, no vendor lock-in required. Eris on Azure lets you do this quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of different options for Azure clients are supported and we are continuing to add functionality for new protocols. Per Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/azure-baas-update-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; last month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;(Eris is a) leading platform for industrial applications of smart contract technology. Eris:db blockchains are permissionable, logic optimized blockchains which run EVM compatible blockchains within a permissioned blockchain network. The following templates are in the pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Single validator eris:db blockchain client for rapid prototyping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seven validator eris:db blockchain network for stable demonstration chains spread across user selected Azure data centers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Azure clients will be able to upload the details of their permissioning requirements for the blockchain network in question as part of the instantiation process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, right? We think so too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, we&amp;rsquo;re very pleased about this and looking forward to accomplishing great things in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning about Eris for the first time and want to know what it is? Our partners at Microsoft &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/azure-blockchain-as-a-service-update-4/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sum up the platform pretty well&lt;/a&gt;, so I will just quote them here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eris is a universal blockchain platform capable of running any client for a public blockchain and any client for a permissioned blockchain which is open sourced. The Eris platform greatly reduces the complexity of creating blockchain based applications. Integrate multiple blockchain, distributed file storage, and other distributed systems into a cohesive application. Eris also makes it simple and easy for your organization to get started using permissionable, smart contract capable blockchains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple and easy. And even, dare I say it, fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, or would like to get started using our free, open-source platform today, we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you. Please direct any queries to contact@erisindustries.com in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Release: v0.11</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2016/01/16/v011-release/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost/2016/01/16/v011-release/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/29882791@N02/8300286720/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; | append:&amp;lsquo;/monax.jpg&amp;rsquo; | img }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is with great pleasure that I announce that version 0.11 of &lt;code&gt;eris&lt;/code&gt; is officially released. This version represents a significant upgrade from the 0.10 version of eris in two major areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the pathways and workflow around smart contracts actually exists rather than being a duct-taped and bubble-gummmed pathway no one could work with. Second, we have improved our documentation, tutorials, and perhaps most importantly, our test coverage across the platform tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the focus of our 0.10 release series was on features as we completely redesigned the entire platform between our 0.9 release and our 0.10 release. That complete redesign meant that our entire suite of documentation and tutorials were completely out of date. That has been drastically improved and eris is much easier for new users to get up to speed than it ever has been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a definite tension within software development between wanting to have well tested code and not really knowing what you want the code to look like. When one is designing a platform using relatively new software paradigms, one can waste time spending too much time developing tests. Particularly when you don&amp;rsquo;t even really know &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; to test this new platform because you aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly sure what the platform will look like. This was the tension which we found ourselves in during the devleopment of the 0.10 release sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during the 0.11 sequence we turned our attention away from adding features (with the exception of the smart contracts pathways) and put our attention squarely on testing and stability. And eris is a much stronger tool for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken a look at eris in the past, or if you have had troubles with the complexity required to handle smart contract, permissionable blockchains, take a look again. It&amp;rsquo;s probably easier than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris makes it easy to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run nodes for established blockchains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run middleware which hooks into established blockchins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instantiate new (permissioned) blockchains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build, test, and deploy smart contract packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work easily with IPFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.erisindustries.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt; at the very new and very improved eris! Eris might not be exactly what you thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eris Industries calls on UK business to oppose the Investigatory Powers Bill</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2015/11/02/ipbill/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost/2015/11/02/ipbill/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eris Industries&amp;rsquo; position is that this proposed bill would impinge vital and legitimate business interests of our company. It is also a threat to national security and the well-being of the people of the United Kingdom. The &amp;ldquo;compromise&amp;rdquo; reported by the Telegraph on encryption is nothing of the sort and, if enacted, will present an unacceptable risk to doing digital business. We call on the business community to join us in opposing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who have followed Eris Industries for a little while will know that the members of our team are &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/2015/05/29/ei-comms-data-bill/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;long-standing opponents&lt;/a&gt; of the Snooper&amp;rsquo;s Charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was thus with some disappointment that we discovered today - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11970391/Internet-firms-to-be-banned-from-offering-out-of-reach-communications-under-new-laws.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;as reported in the Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; - that the British government isn&amp;rsquo;t going to seek to &amp;ldquo;ban encryption,&amp;rdquo; but - if the reporting is correct - merely mandate that the encryption that telecommunications firms provide must be breakable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been marketed as the Government &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3299110/Theresa-backtracks-snoopers-charter-drops-plans-let-police-spies-internet-browsing-history.html?ITO=1490&amp;amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;amp;ns_campaign=1490&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;backing down&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; This is spin: they have done anything but.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake that the &amp;ldquo;compromise&amp;rdquo; position is, in practice, exactly the same as the previous one. It is only more precisely-worded. &lt;strong&gt;Mandating breakable encryption is the same thing as banning encryption&lt;/strong&gt;. The difference is one of degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-conversation=&#34;none&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Note section 189(4)(d). This bill doesn&amp;#39;t mandate backdoors. It merely gives gov&amp;#39;t power to order them long-term. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/TH6ed6mdB6&#34;&gt;https://t.co/TH6ed6mdB6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Preston J. Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/prestonjbyrne/status/661913944496427008&#34;&gt;November 4, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where a corporate such as Apple, Google, or WhatsApp knows about or engineers a weakness in encryption, this will allow an attacker to discover and exploit that same weakness, no matter who the attacker is. Whether the Home Secretary, a foreign state, a terrorist, or that most insidious of threats, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/30/second-teenager-arrested-over-talktalk-data-breach&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bored teen-ager&lt;/a&gt;, all are equal in the eyes of mathematics, which does not care who you are, whether you have a warrant, or whether your actions proceed from good or bad intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only prerequisite is that you&amp;rsquo;re clever enough to find these weaknesses. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;indeed many people are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is proposed by the Government is like putting an unguarded back door on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Knox&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fort Knox&lt;/a&gt;. Walking in the front door is impossible. But take your time and patiently look for it, and once you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten into the vault, you can do whatever you please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a civil liberties angle which I could harp on about all day. However, being an entrepreneur, first and foremost I have a business to run. And my business provides cryptographically-secure software for financial services firms, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even placing civil liberties concerns to one side, there is no escaping the fact that this bill - as described in the press - is unfit for enterprise. Financial services, in particular, is a data-driven business: storing data, guaranteeing its integrity, and communicating it faithfully and far from prying eyes. Which people do a rather great deal of, whether sending a payment instruction or sending an e-mail negotiating the terms of an upcoming deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a modern economy to function, the integrity of data cannot be questioned and the privacy of these communications - across the many channels people use to send them - must be assured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure, untampered end-to-end encryption is the only technology that accomplishes this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible, of course, that a carve-out for industry has been included - which would mean that there is one law of the land for corporate infrastructure, and another one for everybody else. If this were the case, this would be a profoundly unjust law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even if it were, I find it difficult to see how the Government will be able to distinguish between a WhatsApp or BlackBerry message sent in the context of some bankers putting together an IPO, by a couple of rambunctious teen-agers gossiping, by yuppie hipsters debating the merits of flannel, or by a gang of criminals. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSL&lt;/a&gt; is not built to know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is not the case, and this rule is to apply equally to everyone, it means that SSL, VPNs, PGP, and all manner of everyday communications infrastructure upon which business relies would be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack vector on these services would be straight through the top: compromising the companies that provide them. In other words, the attack vector is your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent widespread backdoors are paired with data retention requirements, this also means the digital life of every man, woman and child in Britain could not be safely stored. These data too would need their own statutory back door. The personal information and private lives of everyone would be subject to an unprecedented, and frankly almost indescribable, level of threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the security services can get to these files, so can anyone else. If this data were to be compromised, the TalkTalk hack would look like a tea party by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at the incalculable harm to members of the British public caused by the TalkTalk hack - particularly considering that this attack was allegedly carried out by a couple of children - we should understand that what the Government proposes will not make us safer. It will make us less safe. It will make our businesses less safe. It will make our country less safe. If public safety is the issue, the agenda being put to Parliament by the Conservatives should be &lt;strong&gt;the adoption of more and stronger cryptography, not less.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, because cryptography is open-source (i.e., the tools are freely available to anyone) &lt;strong&gt;banning Google or WhatsApp from providing unbreakable, end-to-end encryption will do nothing&lt;/strong&gt; to stop bad actors from using other, nigh-unbreakable, tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put differently, anyone who is willing to comply with this legislation is thus likely also to be the sort of person whose communications are deserving of the strongest possible protection. Such as a bank and its customers, or a lawyer and her clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must ask ourselves why the Government really wants this legislation. British police &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000/Part_III&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;already have the power to compel someone, on penalty of imprisonment, to disclose cryptographic keys&lt;/a&gt; under RIPA (i.e., to compel decryption on the order of intelligence or police authorities - no judicial warrant required).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalists should ask the Government how many times, in practice, anyone has refused to do so since that law entered into force. Presumably if mass encryption is a major issue for the police, then refusals to comply with RIPA would happen all the time. I think they will find the answer is a little different (I cannot find the link, but I believe it was so few as to be countable on one hand). Or how many times the Home Secretary has required such extraordinary warrants to date, or plans to require them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legislation solves a problem no-one has with a law that no-one wants. And it - if it contains the provision as reported - makes very little commercial sense. If passed, it would have the result that nobody should trust software that has the &amp;ldquo;Made in Britain&amp;rdquo; mark on it. Furthermore, it would present a serious risk to anyone doing business in the UK in a legally compliant way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/2015/05/29/ei-comms-data-bill/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on several occasions&lt;/a&gt; this year, encouraged the businesses and the people of the United Kingdom to join us in opposing the Snooper&amp;rsquo;s Charter. We do so again today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We (Finally) Built Eris!</title>
      <link>http://localhost/2015/08/19/v010-release/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost/2015/08/19/v010-release/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since we officially started working on &amp;ldquo;eris&amp;rdquo;, and we are (finally) ready to move a product we are proud to call &amp;ldquo;eris&amp;rdquo; into beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, version 0.10 of the eris platform is released. Parts of the 0.10 release series have been released (which I mean on stable master branches of the requisite repositories) for a while now. But as of today the centerpiece of the platform going forward, a cli tool we call &lt;code&gt;eris&lt;/code&gt; is &amp;ldquo;released&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 0.10 release of &lt;code&gt;eris&lt;/code&gt; represents a significant step forward for our work. After our &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2015/05/27/v09-release/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;0.9 release&lt;/a&gt; we understood that we needed to completely redesign how the platform operated. Some of the reasons for why this was necessary are included in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.erisindustries.com/documentation/eris-cli/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;platform&amp;rsquo;s Readme&lt;/a&gt; in the Background Section. Other reasons for why this was necessary were included in &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2015/08/09/deprecation-warnings/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a blog post about our deprecation warnings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few portions of this release which I would like to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we no longer make an eris blockchain &amp;ndash; permissioned or unpermissioned. We are, however, actively supporting the Tendermint open source project where our permissioned smart contract network efforts have continued. At this point &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;building on eris&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; does not imply that a developer is building on a specific blockchain and &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;eris dapps&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; do not imply that the smart contract network involved be built by any one particular project. In other words, we have gone fully blockchain agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris sits at a layer in the stack between a blockchain client and the operating system. In other words, eris is an &lt;strong&gt;application platform&lt;/strong&gt; it is not a blockchain client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have gone &amp;ldquo;all in&amp;rdquo; on Docker. While some folks have mixed feelings about docker, and while there are still edge cases, it empowers a significant advancement for application developers due to its &amp;ldquo;build once, run the exact same anywhere&amp;rdquo; design structure. One of our alpha testers said about eris, &amp;ldquo;Got a BTC node and an Ethereum node running. Even with the little fiddling, that was FAST!&amp;rdquo; We would not be able to do this without Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With eris, developers and users can simply and easily build and operate smart contract and blockchain backed applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eris makes it easy to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run nodes for established blockchains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run middleware which hooks into established blockchins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instantiate new (permissioned) blockchains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build, test, and deploy smart contract packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build, test, and deploy dapps based on the following frameworks:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pyepm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eris-pm (EPM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simple gulp based dapps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work easily with IPFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.erisindustries.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt; at the very new and very improved eris! Eris might not be exactly what you thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;
