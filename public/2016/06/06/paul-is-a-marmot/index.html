        <p>I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce that Paul du Plessis has joined Eris as a senior product manager on our success team. He started two weeks ago and will be working out of our Berlin office.</p>

<p>Paul will be helping us in two primary, and very related areas. His primary duty will be as senior product manager. In this capacity he will provide the interface between our Library team who is responsible for building the smart contract bundles which provides the basis of our revenue side on the one hand and the sales team who is responsible for selling these bundles into the market.</p>

<p>A great product manager acts as the interface between technical folks and sales teams. The product manager is able to package the benefits of a given &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that is for sale in a manner which helps the sales team show buyers what problems are solved by the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; in a cohesive and concise manner. It is a crucial role for a company seeking to sell into an enterprise setting.</p>

<p>But it also works the other way. Pulling what the technical folks build and packaging for a sales team is only half the job. The other half of the job is to help the technical folks (in our case on our Library team which is led by Jan) understand what customer&rsquo;s concerns and priorities are so that roadmaps can be agreed, produced, and communicated appropriately.</p>

<p>In other words, product managers are the key to the &ldquo;Conjoined Triangles of Success&rdquo; (a concept which will be familiar to those that watch <a href="http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley" target="_blank">Silicon Valley</a>):</p>

<p>{{ page.date | date: &ldquo;%Y&rdquo; | append:&lsquo;/triangles_of_success.jpg&rsquo; | img }}</p>

<p>Jokes about satire TV shows aside, Paul is uniquely suited to help us here.</p>

<p>When we first advertised for the position which we eventually hired Paul to fill, I joked with Brian that it was the &ldquo;ideas human&rdquo; position. I am fairly sure that we received more applications for this role than any other role we have ever advertised. As part of the process, we asked applicants to provide an overview of a smart contract application (or, <a href="https://db.erisindustries.com/eris/2016/06/05/ecosystem-applications/" target="_blank">ecosystem application</a>) they would like to see built. There was a wide variety of answers, however Paul&rsquo;s was one of the only applications which focused not on tokenizing and trading assets (where the &ldquo;blockchain zeitgeist&rdquo; has been for far too long). Rather, Paul&rsquo;s response focused on the relational processes between ecosystem participants. An incredibly marmot-y answer indeed. It was a great start because we were really filtering for a grounded perspective as to logical entry points for our tech along with a clear storyline. And Paul delivered in droves from his first submission and through the entirety of the hiring process.</p>

<p>After working in insurance in South Africa where he hails from, Paul has recently completed his MBA and has been long interested in how blockchain and smart contracts technology can be used to improve processes which cut across participants in an ecosystem. This combination, of a strong business acumen along with an deep understanding of the technical capacity and limits of the technology we build, is exactly what we were looking for in a product manager. His experience in insurance will be vital as that vertical continues to learn about ecosystem applications and how this paradigm of building software can assist real pain points. We couldn&rsquo;t be more excited to have someone with Paul&rsquo;s experience and abilities on our team.</p>

<p>His secondary duty is to assist with project management on the one build-out we will be doing this year. This is very related to his product manager duties; although it is distinct from those. In the build-out which we are working on, we are working both with the client enterprise as well as one of their systems integrators. This paradigm, with our company providing our FOSS base platform and smart contracts, a systems integrator providing the middleware and front end, delivering to a subscribing enterprise client is one that we think is largely scalable. This project gives Paul a &ldquo;coal faced&rdquo; perspective on the pain points builders are currently faced that will be essential for his (and, of course, our) success.</p>

<p>Yet as a company that is relentlessly focused on building and taking to market scalable products, the project management responsibilities Paul is currently embarking on are secondary in nature to his ultimate focus which will be in helping to refine, package, and roadmap our complex smart contract systems. Paul has a strong and clear focus, as do most of the marmots, on building actual products. This mindset is essential to our success in the market, and I for one am incredibly pleased that Paul has joined us to help extend our efforts and expand our capacity to deliver.</p>

<p>We look forward to great things from Paul and you should too! If you&rsquo;re in Berlin or London feel free to buy him a beer and let us know how we can best help your organization get up to speed with the next generation of data and process management infrastructure.</p>
