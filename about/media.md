### **Testimonials**

>  "The Swiss Army Knife of the blockchain."

-[PricewaterhouseCoopers](https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2016/01/28/pwc/), as told to [*CoinDesk*](http://www.coindesk.com/pwc-fintech-director-disruptive-blockchain-could-create-winners-and-losers/), 23/02/16

> "Eris Industries (is) a leader in using smart contracts to automate business processes between organizations."

-[PricewaterhouseCoopers](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/fintech/blockchain.html)

> "The Eris platform greatly reduces the complexity of creating blockchain-based applications... (and) makes it simple and easy for your organization to get started using permissionable, smart contract capable blockchains.”

-[Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/azure-blockchain-as-a-service-update-4/), 28/01/16

> "Five stars... Eris provides a solid platform for building advanced financial applications based one the of the most interesting and probably misunderstood technologies, namely smart contracts and blockchain."

-[Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Other-Programming-Files/Eris.shtml), 17/02/16 

>  "A customized ([ErisDB](/components/erisdb/)) blockchain is used for Microwork.io’s reputation system... the high level of customization offered by (ErisDB) made it the right choice for Microwork.io during the development process.”

-Microwork.io in [*Bitcoin Magazine*](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/20313/microwork-io-uses-smart-contracts-coordinate-small-tasks-worldwide/), 07/05/15

### **Media**

>  "The key point is that (Eris Industries' technology) could be a **huge cost-saver** in terms of corporate infrastructure."

-[*Business Insider*](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/europe-15-most-innovative-finance-startups-2015-1#14-eris-industries-all-about-data-2), 16/01/15

>  “Eris’ model might actually change the existing financial industry more so than the solely Bitcoin-based businesses have done to date.”

-[*American Banker*](http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/practical-ways-to-use-blockchain-technology-could-win-over-banks-1074001-1.html), 27/04/15

> "In looking at efficiency gains, the potential changes to existing practices and transaction structure in capital markets are expansive. Eris (Industries) sees a host of new realities that could govern how transactions are conducted and managed through blockchain automation."

-[*American Banker*](http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/can-blockchain-tech-really-unclog-the-capital-markets-1079545-1.html?zkPrintable=1&nopagination=1), 24/02/16

>  “The nice thing about the Eris proposition is that they see the value of blockchain systems linked to the data structure *and* the use case... combining trust and self-serving utility into the design allows for **better and more efficient** systems because it allows for reversibility. **Flexibility is needed** if these systems are to account for human fallibility.”

-[*Financial Times - Alphaville*](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/03/20/2122415/blockchains-as-a-public-and-private-resource/?Authorised=false5hrwiey), 20/03/15

>  “What’s key (with Eris' technology) is the idea of “smart contracts,” which function as a set of automated instructions for a computer to perform if a set of conditions is in place. Blockchain-adjudicated smart contracts can make organizational processes more efficient and integrated.

> A proprietary blockchain solution could... allow a multinational to **fluidly integrate communications** between the otherwise independently formed databases and software systems of different subsidiaries in different countries.”

### **Subject-matter experts:**

>  "...**Eris can be distinguished based on their focus.** They are the result of the continuous search for ‘non-currency’ applications of blockchain technologies."

-[EBA](https://www.abe-eba.eu/about-eba/eba-at-a-glance/) Working Group on Electronic and Alternative Payments, "[*Cryptotechnologies: a major IT innovation and catalyst for change*](https://www.abe-eba.eu/downloads/knowledge-and-research/EBA_20150511_EBA_Cryptotechnologies_a_major_IT_innovation_v1_0.pdf)," 11/05/15

> "For our clients, if they're going to be investing in this stuff, it's not going to be on a whim... so in the short-term, we're going to do this because it **saves money** on clearing and settlement. But in the long run, we're going to do it because it's going to restructure the way that parts of an industry are going to work...

> ...that's what kind of caught my eye when I first read (Eris') stuff: that this is realistic."

-Dave Birch, [*Tomorrow's Transactions*](http://www.chyp.com/podcasts/preston-byrne-eris-industries-27032015/), 27/03/15

>  "(Eris Industries has) managed to **beat to market other proposed systems** and it uses agnostic tech (not necessarily Bitcoin 'rails'), to settle/move contracts on a blockchain."

-Tim Swanson, "[*Eris launches an actual smart contract decentralized application platform*](http://www.ofnumbers.com/2014/12/17/eris-launches-an-actual-smart-contract-decentralized-application-platform/)," 17/12/14

>  "(Eris is) **thinking almost 5 years too far ahead.** Here’s a definite business goal, especially in terms of enterprise. If you can roll this out and do immense cost savings for companies, it’s a definite winner."

-Simon de la Rouviere, "[*Eris and Dapp Infrastructure*](http://simondlr.com/post/105806054868/eris-dapp-infrastructure)", 21/12/14

>  "For a system like Eris, the security is as good as the person in charge [that] you trust. Now if you do a system where, say (you've) got five different banks on five different continents, each signing blocks in a 3 of 5 system — that can be very secure."
