“The nice thing about the Eris proposition is that they see the value of blockchain systems linked to the data structure *and* the use case...combining trust and self-serving utility into the design allows for better and more efficient systems”

“What’s key (with Eris' technology) is the idea of “smart contracts,” which function as a set of automated instructions for a computer to perform if a set of conditions is in place.

A proprietary blockchain solution could... allow a multinational to fluidly integrate communications between the otherwise independently formed databases and software systems of different subsidiaries in different countries.”
