### **Mainstream media:**

>  "The key point is that (Eris Industries' technology) could be a **huge cost-saver** in terms of **corporate infrastructure**."

-[*Business Insider*](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/europe-15-most-innovative-finance-startups-2015-1#14-eris-industries-all-about-data-2), 16/01/15

>  “The nice thing about the Eris proposition is that they see the value of **blockchain systems linked to the data structure *and* the use case**...combining trust and self-serving utility into the design allows for **better and more efficient** systems”

-[*Financial Times - Alphaville*](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/03/20/2122415/blockchains-as-a-public-and-private-resource/?Authorised=false5hrwiey), 20/03/15

>  “Eris’ model might actually **change the existing financial industry more** so than the solely Bitcoin-based businesses have done to date.”

-[*American Banker*](http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/practical-ways-to-use-blockchain-technology-could-win-over-banks-1074001-1.html), 27/04/15

>  “What’s key (with Eris' technology) is the idea of “smart contracts,” which function as a set of automated instructions for a computer to perform if a set of conditions is in place. Blockchain-adjudicated smart contracts can **make organizational processes more efficient and integrated.** A proprietary blockchain solution could... allow a multinational to fluidly integrate communications between the otherwise independently formed databases and software systems of different subsidiaries in different countries.”

-[*The Wall Street Journal*](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/14/bitbeat-blockchains-without-coins-stir-tensions-in-bitcoin-community/), 14/4/15

>  "A customized ([ErisDB](https://erisdb.erisindustries.com)) blockchain is used for Microwork.io’s reputation system. (ErisDB) is a blockchain platform built by Eris Industries... The **high level of customization** offered by (ErisDB) made it the **right choice** for Microwork.io during the **development process**.”

### **Industry experts and reports:**

>  "(Application) stacks such as... **Eris can be distinguished based on their focus.** They are the result of the continuous search for ‘non-currency’ applications of blockchain technologies."

-EBA Working Group on Electronic and Alternative Payments, "[*Cryptotechnologies: a major IT innovation and catalyst for change*](https://www.abe-eba.eu/downloads/knowledge-and-research/EBA_20150511_EBA_Cryptotechnologies_a_major_IT_innovation_v1.0.pdf)," 11/04/15

> "For our clients, if they're going to be investing in this stuff, it's not going to be on a whim... so in the short-term, we're going to do this because it **saves money on clearing and settlement**. But in the long run, we're going to do it because it's going to restructure the way that parts of an industry are going to work... 

> ...that's what kind of caught my eye when I first read (Eris') stuff: that **this is realistic.**"

-Dave Birch, [*Tomorrow's Transactions*](http://www.chyp.com/podcasts/preston-byrne-eris-industries-27032015/), 27/03/15

>  "...they have managed to **beat to market other proposed systems** and it uses agnostic tech (not necessarily Bitcoin 'rails'), to settle/move contracts on a blockchain."

-Tim Swanson, "[*Eris launches an actual smart contract decentralized application platform*](http://www.ofnumbers.com/2014/12/17/eris-launches-an-actual-smart-contract-decentralized-application-platform/)," 17/12/14

>  "(Eris is) **thinking almost 5 years too far ahead.** Here’s a definite business goal, especially in terms of enterprise. If you can roll this out and do **immense cost savings for companies**, it’s a definite winner."

-Simon de la Rouviere, "[*Eris and Dapp Infrastructure*](http://simondlr.com/post/105806054868/eris-dapp-infrastructure)", 21/12/14

>  "For a system like Eris, the security is as good as the person in charge [that] you trust. Now if you do a system where, say (you've) got five different banks on five different continents, each signing blocks in a 3 of 5 system — **that can be very secure.**"
