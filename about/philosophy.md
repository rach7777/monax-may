### When We Started Eris Industries, We Asked Two Questions

1) Is it possible to build applications which have the benefits of interconnectedness, but without servers? **It is**. Distributed applications can perform the same functions of modern web applications by enlisting users to participate in the management and security of these applications' data.

2) Is it possible to create data-driven interactions which are both autonomous and legally compliant? **It is**. Data-driven interactions are not exempt from legal norms and procedures, and platforms capable of operating within existing legal frameworks will be profoundly useful to businesses and individuals alike.

With Eris Industries' open-source **Distributed Application Software Stack**, developers can rapidly design, test, and deploy distributed applications which are as flexible, user-friendly, and legally compliant as they are secure.

### Participatory Architecture Reduces Server Costs

Modern interactive applications require developers to expend vast sums of money on servers. These costs are usually offset by stockpiling users' data and selling this information to advertisers. Advances in distributed computing simplify application scaling architecture by enlisting users to play an active part in an application's security, management, and maintenance.

Participatory architecture allows users to benefit from the interconnectedness of the modern internet without needing to surrender control over their data, or their privacy, to obtain it.

Eris Industries' **Distributed Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers to embrace participatory architecture and challenge existing providers of "free" internet services such as streaming video, cloud storage and social networking, as well as to design more traditional industrial applications such as asset management and value transfer, at a substantially lower start-up cost than existing software architecture permits.

### Design Philosophy

Most blockchain systems in use today are built with the sole purpose of securely transferring tokens representing monetary value among a network of mutually, and equally, untrustworthy actors. They require a mentality of data permanence. They are built to be standalone monoliths, and their security and consensus models are largely static.

We feel that modern internet services require more flexibility and modularity. We do not think that all actors in a system are untrustworthy. We do not see all data as requiring permanence in order to be useful. We feel the world is complex and that change is inevitable. We build software which embraces this philosophy.

Our software is easy to set up, easy to parameterise, and fully functional for immediate use by developers. Best of all, it's completely free to use.

### Enterprise Ready

Eris is the first platform that allows the full potential of blockchain based technologies to be realized in business.

By combining blockchain-housed systems of smart contracts, businesses can take many data-driven human relationships and reduce them to code – guaranteeing accurate and consistent execution of functions which previously required human discretion to manage.

We are working with a number of corporations to discuss how our technology can improve their businesses. If you have a query as to how our solutions can be put to use in your firm, please contact our team at [contact@erisindustries.com](mailto:contact@erisindustries.com).

### Making Smart Contracts Work

Participatory architecture is made possible by smart contracts which allow users to securely interact with each other without centralized servers that must be trusted. Any type of information or interaction – whether representations of an asset to be transfered, a task to be completed, or a decision to be taken – is capable of being securely managed, audited, and transferred with and by smart contracts.

Smart contracts can also be structured to reflect and deal in real-world rights, obligations, and regulatory requirements. There should not be a compromise between legal compliance and distributed applications, as we see so often today; smart contracts thus represent a significant advance on existing organizational technology solutions.

Eris makes it easy for developers to simplify and automate data-driven interactions without exposing platform operators to unnecessary legal risk.

### Why Eris?

A better world is a smarter world. Leveraging good technology to work toward a smarter world entails observing a situation, defining a problem, determining a solution, and testing the result. Over and over again.

The more precise our problem definitions, the more effective our solutions will be. The more rigorous our testing is, the more certain our solutions will be. The faster we iterate, the more resilient our solutions will be.

Smart contracts and participatory architecture allow developers to rapidly iterate, test, and evolve solutions to complex problems in a cost-effective and simplified manner.
