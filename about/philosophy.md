### When We Started Eris Industries, We Asked Two Questions

1) Is it possible to build applications which have the benefits of interconnectedness, but without a hub-and-spoke architecture? **It is**. Distributed applications can perform the same functions of modern hub-and-spoke applications by reenvisioning their data management strategies and by enlisting users to participate in the management and security of these applications' data.

2) Is it possible to create data-driven interactions which are autonomous, offer process assurance, and are legally compliant? **It is**. Data-driven interactions are not exempt from legal norms and procedures, and platforms capable of operating within existing legal frameworks will be profoundly useful to businesses and individuals alike. Yet, there are solutions which offer the promise of both reduced compliance costs and increased visibility to business process necessary to operate and govern organizations (corporate and non-corporate).

With Eris Industries' open-source **Distributed Application Software Stack**, developers can rapidly design, test, and deploy distributed applications which are as flexible, user-friendly, and legally compliant as they are secure.

### Participatory Architecture Distributes Data Management Costs

The same efficiency gains which drive technology in the open source community can be applied to data & process management. Startups, enterprises and, increasingly, governments use and contribute to open-source software because it effectively distributes software development costs across organisations.

Using [smart contracts]({{ site.data.sites["docs"].url }}/explainers/smart_contracts/), organisations are able to adopt a similar pattern of cost distribution with respect to process management – which are currently fully borne by all parties to a commercial relationship.

Smart contracts effectively allow for process compliance to be conducted in a collaborative, participatory manner better suited for information age organisations. [Blockchains]({{ site.data.sites["docs"].url }}/explainers/blockchains/), on the other hand, allow for data integrity processes to be implemented in a similar manner.

We call this paradigm participatory architecture.

Eris Industries' **Distributed Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers to embrace participatory architecture and challenge traditional commercial, industrial, and goverment applications at a substantially more verifiable level than existing software architecture permits.

### Design Philosophy

At Eris, we believe that smart contract and blockchain technologies give developers a powerful tool set for tackling coordination and process problems.

We believe that this ability to express business, financial, governance, and legal processes in code, when combined with automatic and secure execution of that code, will usher in numerous systemic changes to existing modes of doing business across a wide range of verticals.

We further believe that the true power of smart contracts is in their ability to provide verifiable, repeatable processes to organisations, big and small.

Our software is easy to set up, easy to parameterise, and fully functional for immediate use by developers. Best of all, it's completely free to use.

### Compliance Ready

Eris is the first platform that allows the full potential of blockchain based technologies to be realized in regulated organizations, such as enterprises, non-profits, and governmental bodies.

By combining blockchain-housed systems of smart contracts, any organization can take many data-driven human relationships and reduce them to code – guaranteeing accurate and consistent execution of functions which previously required human discretion to manage. This is what we call **process assurance**, and smart contracts are one of the most promising technologies available in this area.

### Making Smart Contracts Work

Smart contracts can be structured to reflect and deal in real-world rights, obligations, and regulatory requirements. There should not be a compromise between legal compliance and distributed applications, as we see so often today; smart contracts thus represent a significant advance on existing organizational technology solutions.

Smart contracts can also be structured to build the backbone for **any** interactive application which needs to be ran in a globally (or regionally) distributed fashion and have a harmonized state across the nodes providing the data and process management portions of the application.

Eris makes it easy for developers to simplify and automate data-driven interactions without exposing platform operators to unnecessary legal risk.

### Why Eris?

A better world is a smarter world. Leveraging good technology to work toward a smarter world entails observing a situation, defining a problem, determining a solution, and testing the result. Over and over again.

The more precise our problem definitions, the more effective our solutions will be. The more rigorous our testing is, the more certain our solutions will be. The faster we iterate, the more resilient our solutions will be.

Smart contracts and participatory architecture allow developers to rapidly iterate, test, and evolve solutions to complex problems in a highly verifiable and simple manner.
