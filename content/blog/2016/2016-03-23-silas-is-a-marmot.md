I'm very pleased to announce that Silas Davis has joined Monax as a developer on our platform team. He started this week and will be working out of our London office.

Silas got in touch with us after Preston first started the Company's public advocacy campaign against the #IPBill [in the middle of 2015](https://blog.erisindustries.com/2015/05/29/ei-comms-data-bill/). As a privacy advocate he was impressed that a little start up out of nowhere was going on national radio (which, oddly, is still a thing) and strongly advocating against what the government said it was planning to do.

In his first marmot-y move he sent me an email (at that time the contact@... still came to my inbox) and said he wanted to chat. So we went out for a beer and talked for a bit. Alas, he was gainfully employed at the time with a quite hot startup so we'd have to wait.

Over time, Silas got to know the marmots, and we got to know him. Although he was still working full time with his previous employer we went out for drinks now and again. After his startup [exited](http://www.networkworld.com/article/3031011/smartphones/why-did-microsoft-buy-swiftkey-hint-its-not-about-keyboards.html) he was ready for a new challenge. And so, this week, with great pleasure and a little fanfare he joins the marmots.

Silas will be working with the `eris chains` team. His background in theoretical mathematics and machine learning (which is mostly what he was working on at SwiftKey) fills a gap in our current chains team. As chains grow in size and import, our ability to smoothly facilitate machine learning algorithms to be ran against the data held in blockchains increases in importance.

There are tons of points of interactivity between the space that blockchains occupy (namely, facilitating business process automation at a network level rather than individual enterprise level) and the space that machine learning occupies (namely, gleaning insights from large data lakes). Silas will be our lead in making sure that there is a smooth flow between these two paradigms.

Silas and Ben will be our primary point folks for the `eris chains` product moving forward. There is a bucketload of work which is needed on eris chains as we continue to address the big current challenges in blockchains in our own marmoty way and we couldn't be more pleased to have Silas on board.

Silas will also be working with Rick on the ops side where needed.

We look forward to great things from Silas and you should too! Give him a shout [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/silas_davis) and if you're in London feel free to buy him a coffee and let us know how we can best help your organization get up to speed with the next generation of data and process management infrastructure.
