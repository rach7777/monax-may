I'm very pleased to announce that Jason Banks has joined Monax as a legal engineer on our library team. He started on Monday and will be working out of our Berlin office.

When we first started Monax Industries (then called Eris Industries), I had a long conversation with our seed stage funders about who our target employees would be in the first few stages of our growth. One of the profiles we needed, which seemed insane in late 2014, was lawyer-coders. Those who sit at the intersection of law and code were rare in late 2014, and the market is not exactly saturated with these folks now. However, the market is also not absent such folks.

This human capital need was based upon our revenue model, which even at that time was the same as it is now: selling bundles of enterprise grade smart contracts to large enterprises (and, soon, startups as well).

These smart contracts are bundles of business logic which sit on top of various blockchain clients operating various blockchain networks (thus, why , our software, is [blockchain agnostic](/2016/04/03/wtf-is-eris/)).

That is all well and good in the abstract one may say, but how does one *actually* do that? **Very carefully** is my usual answer.

I often say that despite getting lumped into finTech as a "blockchain" company, we are really a [legal tech company](/2015/09/15/smart-contracts-intro/). Functionally, smart contracts populate the business logic layer for "ecosystem applications." In other words, they're about providing a system wherein the relationships amongst the actors involved in the ecosystem's application are regulated.

And this, whether we like them or not, is what lawyers do IRL. Lawyering is often a matter of "engineering" the fundamentals of a given relationship. Whether that relationship is a deal between two companies as evidenced by their contract, or the relationship is between an individual and a goverment as evidenced by legislation, lawyers are the professional group most involved in building the "terms and conditions" of relationships.

To build legally compliant ecosystem applications we always analyze and understand how a system currently works as a first step. And to understand how complex relational systems actually work, one typically needs a legal background to be able to understand what the first principles are that drive the relationship. Then we have to distill those existing relational documents into code. But not just any code, most code monkeys could do that, but code that is modular, extensible, and scalable. And this is where having lawyer-coders starts to make sense. Because someone who understands (a) how current systems work, and (b) can distill those into modular code, that's the person who can help craft a new style of building applications.

Jason has one of the most marmot-y profiles one could imagine. He started his professional career as a lawyer, first in New York and quickly thereafter in London. He worked in one of the stereotypical [big law firms](http://lifeinbiglaw.tumblr.com/). Wingtips and all. Then he gave all his suits away and moved to Berlin to be a programmer. In Berlin, Jason worked as a javascript programmer, working to build usable web applications for other companies. He learned about modularity, do not repeat yourself (DRY in coder lingo), and extensibility from a developer's perspective. Life was seemingly good. But then Ben moved across the street.

When we hired Ben he said he would be willing to move to Berlin where we are focusing most of our engineering side hires in Europe. That was great for us as we had been planning to build out our team in Berlin anyway. So Ben moved to Berlin, and lucky for us got an apartment across the street from Jason. As one does with new neighbors they ended up chatting. Ben found out that Jason was a coder who used to be a lawyer and so began the recruitment insurgency campaign.

As Ben told Jason more about what we do at Monax, how we approach the technology, and where we are going, Jason (luckily for us) saw the harmony between the two professional tracks he'd been on. Being able to build legally compliant systems not in word documents, but in a text editor using code is something that many, many lawyers have dreamnt about. Some consider such dreams nightmares, others consider them pleasant. But pretty much everyone that has done document assembly for numerous deals, particularly in finance, has seen how methodical it can be and has wished there were machines around to take out the drudgery of it all.

Jason has been hired as our second legal engineer. He will be pulling from both streams of his background to help us build compliant, scalable, modular, extensible frameworks for complex financial instruments, workflows, and decision mechanics. All using smart contract technology.

Jason has built hundreds of finanical relationships during his time as a lawyer, from the simple to the most complex debt instruments available to very large companies. He has a keen understanding of how such systems work and will be using that knowledge base to help us, slowly but surely, build from the ground up modular frameworks for financial instruments that will allow our smart contracts to be used across a range of asset classes by a range of actors.

Wonderful, exciting days are ahead of us!

We look forward to great things from Jason and you should too! If you're in Berlin feel free to buy him a coffee and let us know how we can best help your organization get up to speed with the next generation of data and process management infrastructure.
