<div class="note">
	<em>Note: since this blog post was written, we have changed our name to Monax Industries and will be changing the name of our product to "Monax" in early 2017. We have left these posts unedited for the purposes of historical record, as the software was named Eris at the time.</em>

See, if we said "Zach does a walkthrough of Eris-cli on YouTube" you might not have clicked. 

But you did click. And we are happy marmots for it. 

Anyway. See below for a walkthrough on YouTube. As promised. If youv'e got any questions, hit us up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/monaxHQ).
