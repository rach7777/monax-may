As of today, we are very excited to announce that the company formerly called Eris Industries is, as of today, Monax.

The idea that led to a company called Eris began with a simple question. Using two (at the time) nascent pieces of what we now call [ecosystem application technology](/explainers/ecosystem_applications) could we build an application that would be capable of distributing content according to rules that were held in a smart contract.

Tyler and I worked late into one night exploring the ideas and suddenly, BOOM, my bittorrent client automagically downloaded a snippet of content. This snippet of content was probably the first instance of a smart contract blockchain being used to facilitate the distribution of content; a paradigm which is increasingly widespread almost to the point of being banal. At the time, though, this was utter magic to both Tyler and I.

Not only magic, but also a dramatic paradigm shift. Using similar paradigms it became increasingly clear that all kinds of existing interactive applications; previously siloed web applications could be "unlocked" and ran not as siloed applications administered by a single company, but rather as an ecosystem.

As I crawled into bed at my usual (extremely late) hour, my wife asked me why had I been up so late and what had I been building? In my dreary state I could only come up with one word: `chaos`. And it fit. The next day I asked Tyler who the goddess of chaos was and `eris` was born.

What we had accomplished, though extremely rudimentary, proved sufficiently to me that we (collectively as an ecosystem application technology sector) were about to unlock a powerful beast. Namely, no less than a new generation of prcess automation software was suddenly within the realm of the possible. All kinds of legal tech, data driven relationship automation, and eventually ecosystem applications with an amazingly wide swathe of industrial uses were no longer locked within academic theories but were actually now possible.

But how would these come to be? How would this sector develop? What lay before us was a daunting set of unknowns. At the time, the zeitgeist was 'bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin'. No one thought that industrial uses of ecosystem application technology was a market that would develop. Well almost no one (outside of us). No one thought that there would be demand for legally compliant smart contract systems. Bitcoin was punk. It was sticking the finger up the backside of the proverbial man. Or in bitcoin's case, the proverbial bank.

During the first few month of the company formerly known as Eris Industries I oscillated between vertigo about the possibilities such a technical base opened and vertigo about the shear amount of work that would be required to get there. Needless to say, for a while we fully lived up to our namesake.

But then things began to change. Slowly. But change they did. The industry developed and matured. The use cases clarified. The momentum built. Business strategies were refined; products and sales pipeliness were developed. Out of chaos came the beginnings of order.

Also there were the marmots. Lots and lots of marmots. Marmots are creatures that despite living in the mountains, relish order and tidiness. Besides the brand identity we have built around these fuzzy creatures, it made sense when it came time to move away from our chaotic beginnings toward a burrow that would be longer lasting to embrace the marmot.

So, as of today, we are turning the **marmot factor up to 11**. It is with great pleasure that I announce that as of today our company is called Monax, which has a bit of [marmoty roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog). As we continue to develop and mature both our technology platform (which will stay called `eris` until it moves to 1.0), our products, and our sales pipeline, we welcome you to join us on this journey.
