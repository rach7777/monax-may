# Fact Patterns, Predictions and Building Decentralized Organizations

Yesterday was a noisy one in the smart contracts world. The ambitious early Ethereum project, The DAO, blew up overnight as token holders found their accounts drained by a hacker. The DAO was the first large, for profit, decentralized autonomous organization deployed on Ethereum’s public blockchain, attracting more than $150 million worth of ether investment in its crowdsale.

The response of in the blockchain community has been a mixture of shock and “I told you so,” especially from lawyers. In smartcontractland, lawyers generally opined that The DAO iteration was too unstable for deployment and said so noisily in blogs and social media. The developers saw a bug, well in advance of release. The lawyers saw a different problem: the DAO loudly eschewed risk management because of the self-executing nature of smart contract code. Lawyers warned that risks for participants in the event of failure ranged from losing their investments to enormous civil liability and possibly jail. Undaunted, the DAO deployed anyway. Here be dragons indeed.

Lawyers predicted the organization’s implosion based on their knowledge of *fact patterns*, that is, the tendency of human relationships to repeat, in cause-and-effect succession, recorded over centuries by the legal system. Common law attorneys learn primarily by studying fact patterns of prior relationship failure to recognize recipes for disaster and avert course accordingly. Fact patterns allow lawyers to distance ourselves from the human stories that might otherewise cloud our analysis and judgment so we can make clearer decisions. In The DAO’s case, red flags were obvious: unlicensed actors in regulated space, refusal to plan for what might happen in the event of a failure and lack of testing. Lawyers also calmly accept that you just can’t convince some people, and the law will be there to both clean up the mess and tell us how to avoid the same problems in the future.

Maybe it didn’t have to be this way, with a little attention to risk management and legal engineering. The same fact patterns that informed lawyers’ prediction of problems with The DAO give us models on which to build, to experiment, to push the limits of blockchain relationships. Risk management and legal engineering allow us to plan how we build according to the succession rules of “what might go wrong?” In legalese, it's about *foreseeablility*.

Since inception, Monax Industries (originally Eris Industries) has led the way on decentralized organization development. It's one of the things that made me want to be a marmot, the company's clear-eyed view on "how to" do DAO and its vision of the huge potential of DAO done right. As [Preston Byrne wrote recently](https://prestonbyrne.com/2016/05/17/thedao-dont-walk-away-restructure/), the blockchain decentralized organization model is worth fixing. Despite manifest risk, people around the globe poured money into The DAO project, demonstrating the traction of cryptographic code-based organizations bringing global actors together to achieve a purpose. The time for decentralized organizations is here. The DAO debacle is a testament to the crucial need to get corporate governance right and a test of the governance of Ethereum as a whole as it weighs its response.

This post is not an “I told you so,” rather, it is an exploration of the value of the fact pattern in both making predictions and building stuff for human use. The DAO fact pattern reinforces these law school lessons: 1) blockchains, like all human undertakings, are not special snowflakes; and 2) the best way to change the law is to learn its rules and carefully direct their evolution, use case by use case. To build new models that humans use, we must study, and learn from, human fact patterns.
