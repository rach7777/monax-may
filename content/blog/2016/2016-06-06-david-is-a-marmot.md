I'm very pleased to announce that David Braun has joined Monax as a software engineer on our applications team.

Dave has actually been a marmot for quite a long little while now. Although only recently did he move into being a full-time employed marmot.

When we were first getting setup, we needed some contractors to help us get started. To get access to high-quality, vetted contractors we utilized a company called [TopTal](https://www.toptal.com/) which we have been very happy with. Dave was one of the folks tasked with assisting to vet javascript programmers before they became authorized contractors within the TopTal ecosystem. He had also spent a lot of time working from various South American localities.

When our listing went live within the TopTal ecosystem, Dave responded within an hour or two I think. He was extraordinarily excited about the possibilities of our tech for solving a range of problems he had experienced and in his extensive travels. I'm 99.99% sure we were the first company in our space to list on TopTal, but the majority of contractors within the TopTal network had never heard of "blockchain technology". To be clear, this was in early 2015 when most of earth hadn't heard of blockchain technology. But Dave had, and he was excited about it!

Yet, there was a challenge. When Dave started working as a contractor for us, our platform was an utter and complete mess. So he got to work infesting the marmots with his perspectives on test-driven development and in how proper software production actually works. He told me during the early days that if he could impart one "thing" to us that it would be the hard won lessons he's learned over decades of building software. I'm pretty sure he said that with a mindset that he may be around for a few months. Indeed, he stuck around for more than a few months!

In particular, Dave has been essential in helping our entire team to develop strong testing mechanisms that ensure our code does what it needs to do. He has been (thankfully) relentless in his pursuit of excellent software throughout his career, and has brought a unique and necessary perspective to our team. His perspectives and drive have provided much of the basis for turning our (admittedly) hacky early attempts into what we can proudly claim as actual software that is currently solving real world problems for our users and customers. And for this I'm very, very thankful.

Dave's duties for us will not really change. He has already been the maintainer of our javascript client library for a while now, and will continue in that vein. Secondarily, he will be helping with our experimentation around next generation smart contracts runtimes.

We look forward to great things from Dave and you should too! If you're in New York feel free to buy him a green tea and let us know how we can best help your organization get up to speed with the next generation of data and process management infrastructure.
