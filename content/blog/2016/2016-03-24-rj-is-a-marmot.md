I'm very pleased to announce that RJ Catalano has joined Monax as a developer on our platform team. He started last week and will be notionally working out of our New York office, but remote from Chicago.

At Monax Industries, we have long been users of the Solidity programming language, however we have not been contributors to the language itself. This has always vexed us because we wanted to play a positive role in helping the language mature, where we were able.

Recently, Brian had a conversation with Christian, the maintainer of Solidity, about how we could contribute. Christian recommended that we get in touch with RJ. And so I did. Luckily for us, RJ was interested in chatting. After he successfully finished our not entirely fast hiring process and finished up his commitments to his previous employer he started this week!

RJ is the final hire for the platform team in this round of hires. Once he and the rest of the new marmots get settled in, our platform team will be firing on many very interesting cylinders.

RJ will be working with the tooling portion of the platform team. In particular, he will be taking over from me as the primary point person on our smart contract tooling. RJ is well versed in the mechanisms for how to work with suites of smart contracts from his time working on the Solidity compiler and other personal projects. These he did in his personal time, but now he will be doing in his work time!

Over time I will be transfering maintainership of `eris:package_manager` and `eris:compilers` over to RJ and he will be leading our efforts to smooth out the friction points for industrial applications of smart contract technology, at least with respect to the actual smart contracts.

As we move into exploring more deeply smart contract machines which are not Ethereum Virtual Machine based (which is on our workplan), he will be deeply involved in how the tooling operates in that new and largely undefined space.

The last major area that RJ will be assisting with is addressing needs which our users have with respect to the Solidity language itself. RJ has already made significant contributions to the Solidity language, and we have long wanted to be "productive" users of that language by contributing where we can. We now have a marmot with the skills and ability to positively contribute rather than simply be ["only users"](/2016/02/03/on-open-source-banks/).

In addition, RJ is our most cryptocurrency friendly marmot, so he will likely be working on marmot-y outreach into that community where we feel we can add value to existing tooling and products in that space.

We look forward to great things from RJ and you should too! If you're in Chicago feel free to buy him a coffee and let us know how we can best help your organization get up to speed with the next generation of data and process management infrastructure.
