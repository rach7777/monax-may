The marmots are everywhere: we're on [Azure](https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2016/01/29/azure/), we've hooked up with [PwC](https://blog.erisindustries.com/products/2016/01/28/pwc/). 

Now we've got one-click deployment on AWS Marketplace - [check it out for yourself](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01BTB1EP8)! 

All of the [eris services](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-services) are available as well as all the other components of the [eris platform](https://monax.io/components/).

Cool, right? We think so too. 

**Temporary Hack**

This just shipped today, so if you use it within the next few days, please run `eris update` after installing to get the latest version of `eris`.
