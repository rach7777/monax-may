	<em>Note: since this blog post was written, we have changed our name to Monax Industries and will be changing the name of our product to "Monax" in early 2017. We have left these posts unedited for the purposes of historical record, as the software was named Eris at the time.</em>

The marmots are everywhere: we're on [Azure](/blog/2016/01/29/azure/), we've hooked up with [PwC](/blog/2016/01/28/pwc/). 

Now we've got one-click deployment on AWS Marketplace - [check it out for yourself](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01BTB1EP8)! 

Cool, right? We think so too. 

**Temporary Hack**

This just shipped today, so if you use it within the next few days, please run `eris update` after installing to get the latest version of `eris`.
