We have been updating our messaging to [a simple three step process](https://docs.erisindustries.com/tutorials/getting-started/) for getting up to speed with our stack:

1. Install
2. Roll
3. Build

Thelonious is no longer supported. Please see the tutorial series linked to above for working with the Eris platform.
