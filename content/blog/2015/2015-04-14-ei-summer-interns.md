### 2015 Summer Internships with Eris Industries

I'll get straight to the point:

#### 1. Application prerequisites

* You must be old enough to vote and be proficient in English.

#### 2. Informal points

* We're thinking we'll probably get applications from current students/recent graduates from university or postgraduate courses, although this is not set in stone. Current or former students of any discipline are welcome to apply.

* You'll be programming. So... yeah. You will need to know how to do that. Our stack is built on a backbone of javascript ([node.js](https://nodejs.org/)), [golang](http://golang.org/), [smart contracts](/docs/solidity/) and container automation using [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) -- experience in at least two of these technologies not required but preferable.

* Digging smart contracts and blockchains helps, but isn't necessary, as this is a pretty niche field (I think there are only two businesses in the world that do it at the moment, of which ours is one).

#### 3. Application requirements

* Read this carefully.

* Write a 250 word project proposal for an open-source, smart contract-driven distributed application and submit it in markdown by pull request to our [Internship Applications repo](https://github.com/monax/internships). **Do not do this if you do not want your proposal to become public and open-source** (Creative Commons licence).

* We'll contact you within two weeks if we'd like to take the application further.

* Regrettably, as we're a small team we will only be able to take on one or two interns this summer. The stack, however, is open-source - so please feel free to play around with it, and to join [our friendly community](http://reddit.com/r/erisindustries). We'd love to hang out!

#### 4. What will happen

* We will teach you the Tao of DAO. You will learn, work on your project, open-source it, and win eternal glory.

#### 5. Place of work

* Anywhere. Our corporate HQ is in London, United Kingdom, but the team is actually spread out all over the place.

#### 6. Duration

* 8-12 weeks, depending on what works.

#### 7. Stipend

* We will pay you a small monthly stipend.
