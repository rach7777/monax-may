	<em>Note: since this blog post was written, we have changed our name to Monax Industries and will be changing the name of our product to "Monax" in early 2017. We have left these posts unedited for the purposes of historical record, as the software was named Eris at the time.</em>

Casey was recently in Switzerland to give two talks. The production quality of these videos is not great (and I'm to blame). My phone recorder needed a paid upgrade to save more than three minutes of an .ogg file -- which I only realized after the first talk. We will be working on adding in some additional content to help understand what was happening on the slides and whiteboard.

While both videos are posted here, most said that the second (the technical side) was much more helpful than the first (the political and social side which underpins the Monax development and design philosophy).

Enjoy!
