We have been updating our messaging to [a simple three step process](https://monax.io/docs/tutorials/) for getting up to speed with our stack:

1. Install
2. Roll
3. Build

Our Thelonious blockchain client is no longer supported or maintained. Please see the tutorial series linked to above for tutorials on how to work with and use the Eris platform.
