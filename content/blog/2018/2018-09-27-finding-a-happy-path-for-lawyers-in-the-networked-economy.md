Developers like to talk about the “happy path,” that is, the way things are supposed to work in the usual course of business using technology. Happy paths can exist in law too, but the happy path is rarely where lawyers get to spend their time.


Attorneys regularly complain about missed opportunities to prevent problems, i.e., preparation to be on a “happy path.” Attorneys wish their clients had spent $5,000 setting their affairs properly in the first place rather than $20,000 to try to clean up the mess down the line. In essence, attorneys wish they could help clients find happy paths rather than later approaching their attorney in distress the attorney can do only so much to alleviate.


Lawyers spend far less time thinking about their own happy path. Because their interests typically align with their clients’ interests, a happy outcome for clients is part of the lawyer’s own happy path: it makes the lawyer’s job easier and allows the lawyer to do his or her best for clients. But what if lawyers could do better still? Is there a still happier path in view?


**What if lawyers could create automated legal products?**

Most lawyers prefer to use their own forms. They have spent years adjusting them and  think of their forms as tried and true. The Agreements Network (“AN”) allows an attorney looking to streamline her practice to turn those forms into legal products specifically tailored to her practice. Whenever a client seeks to instantiate an agreement that does not require bespoke legal services, the attorney can simply direct that client to the correct template on the AN. With the AN, the attorney’s resource is not limited to self-created or inherited templates. Whenever you find a form you’d like to adopt, you can bond your tokens to that particular template instead of starting from scratch.
Each time a client matter can be addressed by a template on the AN, the attorney can decrease time spent and billed. The decrease in billing will encourage clients otherwise wary of exceeding their budget for legal services to check in with their attorney. This keeps clients on their happy path and limits incidences of mistakes that the attorney could have helped avoid but for the client’s sticker shock.

What if you could double the productivity of your staff?
What if  lawyers didn’t need to waste staff time on locating and populating forms? What if all deadlines were communicated electronically and often fulfilled by automated processes? Loading a template onto the AN includes creation of a workflow for the performance of the agreement. With the advent of the coded workflow, the legal agreement ceases to be an inert, inoperative recordation that sits in a drawer and never comes out absent a need to check the record.  The workflow brings the agreement to life by giving the agreement functionality that allows it to implement its own terms with little or no participation by lawyer or client. The workflow enables automated tracking of the obligations to be performed. The more integrations you use along with the workflow, the more the workflow can be automated. The administrative burden on the lawyer’s office will decrease correspondingly.

**What if lawyers could help clients become more educated about their rights and more clear about what they want from their attorney?**

Instantiating agreements from reliable templates already vetted by attorneys educates clients about their own legal needs and teaches them to be more efficient users of legal services and products. Clients take more ownership over their business decisions and have more confidence to take actions on their own when they are 1) supported by the administrative functions automated through the BPM engine and 2) have the ability to easily keep their attorneys thoroughly notified of changes to their legal rights and obligations. If the client shares her data with her lawyer, the attorney will have consistent notice of client activities from the up to date information available through the client’s Monax account. This is much more reliable than irregular notice initiated by clients who are not versed in legal issues or what information attorneys need, resulting in a “happier path” for clients and lawyers alike.

**What if lawyers could increase the return on their investment of time exponentially?**

The expense of providing bespoke legal services limits business growth for any attorney. The [Monax Stack](https://monax.io/blog/2018/09/20/the-monax-stack-what-makes-legal-products-go./) will allow attorneys to 1) better serve clients who would otherwise have to pick and choose to which matters to allocate their legal services budget, 2) encourage such clients to provide notice of all acts of legal significance without worrying about their legal services budget, and 3) serve a bigger market than can afford to pay for bespoke legal services and thereby develop additional clients even before they become financially eligible for bespoke legal services. When an attorney can advise a client or potential client on which template is best suited to their needs, free legal advice turns into incremental income that is affordable to the average consumer and that can grow exponentially for the attorney.

I don’t know about trickle down, but I can bear witness to seeping in all directions. The legal industry is not immune to the disruptive forces and efficiency overhauls affecting the industries where our clients work. Any transactional attorney whose clients have faced the threat of extinction has had to embrace efficiency as an important and relevant measure of the quality of legal services. If we, as attorneys, do not take a hand in the overhaul of our own industry, we will lose our opportunity to ensure the quality of legal services going forward.  The Agreements Network gives attorneys the agency they need. Using the [Agreements Network](https://agreements.network/), attorneys can vet and even design legal products to their own specifications. With the Monax Stack, attorneys WILL have the chance to play a part in how legal products transform both their own practices and the practice of law in general.
