Monax is bursting at the seams with talent from both tech, legal and business.  Our team is split between offices in London,  Edinburgh and New York - and a few remote marmots too!

We’re a diverse bunch of characters, and work hard to bring about the future of legal tech (and we have a lot of fun doing so!). Each post in this blog series will focus on an individual marmot, so you can understand a bit more about the team who are busy bringing the Monax vision to life. First up is one of our friendly Scottish marmots, Greg Hill from Team Distribution:

### Hey Greg, can you introduce yourself in a sentence?

Hey, I’m Greg; I just graduated from my MSc at the University of Edinburgh so I’m the newest Marmot on the block :)

### How did you cross paths with Monax?

I was exploring different opportunities related to blockchains / cryptography and I found out about the novel ideas that Monax were introducing.

### What’s your background?

I’m a hacker at heart; I’ve been programming for as long as I can remember, from my wee chatbots back in high school to my recent publication on machine learning for cryptographic primitive classification.

### What does your work at Monax involve?

As a Site Reliability Engineer I dabble in a bit of everything, though my primary responsibility is the maintenance and operation of our infrastructure. I also work quite heavily with golang to help improve our open-source technologies.


### If you had to choose one aspect of our culture that best defines you, which  one would it be and why? 

As a Marmot, I adapt and overcome; I don’t just “throw my paws up and say it can’t be done.”

Everyone here in the company is wonderfully talented and we’re a social species so it’s easy to communicate when facing a problem.


### What challenges does your role bring and how do you meet them?

Running a ‘blockchain’ is not like ordinary infrastructure because there are so many new variables to consider. The main concern is anticipating causality when updating the architecture but I also need to be on hand to react quickly to any bugs in the matrix ;)

### Tell us a quirky fact about youself

I'm your stereotypical geek, complete with a hidden dinosaur tattoo!

### Thank you so much Greg! 

(Greg has also just had an academic paper published [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/9/9/231) which adds to my suspicion that he is both friendly and smart)

*The word ‘Monax’ comprises part of the binomial name for a groundhog (marmota monax) and our company mascot is a rock n’ roll marmot called Doug. Folks who work for Monax traditionally refer to themselves as marmots, and no prizes for guessing how we came up with the name [Hyperledger Burrow](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-burrow)!
