### Blockchain for Good: Monax Launches ‘Marmota Prime’ Game

*Prizes for predictions challenge include in kind donations to children’s charities*

- Edinburgh - December 13, 2018
Monax, a leader in digital legal infrastructure, has announced the launch of Marmota Prime, a blockchain-based game in which players win donations in kind to charitable organisations, such as The Salvation Army, Toys for Tots and Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Beginning today, new challenges will launch on the platform every 24 hours until February 2nd, 2019. 

Casey Kuhlman, CEO and Co-founder of Monax, said, “At Monax, we aim to make professional functions more efficient through blockchain-based collaborative platforms. We have launched Marmota Prime as a method of simplifying and demonstrating the potential of blockchain technology to connect people around the world to create one ecosystem, as well as to support worthy charitable causes that we wholeheartedly believe in.” 
Marmota Prime players will make predictions on precise temperatures in designated cities around the world. Monax will perform the calculations based on the defined game rules and fulfill obligations to the winners of the different rounds using blockchain technology. 

Marmota Prime leverages The Agreements Network (AN); an open-source, universal blockchain co-founded by Monax in 2018. The AN is a new and efficient way of operating, gathering, and sharing information via decentralised, distributed systems. Wolfram Blockchain Labs will provide computational intelligence to all players during the Marmota Prime Promotional game through an oracle.
Jon Woodard, Wolfram Blockchain Labs, said, "We are pleased to support Monax with computational intelligence from the Wolfram Knowledgebase and look forward to helping educate individuals about the potential of The Agreements Network coupled with computable data.” 

Monax is a leader in smart contract and blockchain technology, having recently announced the official beta launch of The Monax Platform as the latest in its line of smart contract products. The Monax Platform is a collaborative workspace for professionals, complete with market-ready smart contract templates available for individual or commercial use. 
Kuhlman concluded, “With the functions in the game mirrored in the Monax Platform, we hope that this daily challenge will provide a useful introduction to blockchain technology. The Marmota Prime game is proof that legal technology can be not only very powerful, but also quite fun and rewarding. Good luck!”
