Monax is bursting at the seams with talent from both tech, legal and business.  Our team is split between offices in London,  Edinburgh and New York - and a few remote marmots too!

We’re a diverse bunch of characters, and work hard to bring about the future of legal tech (and we have a lot of fun doing so!). Each post in this blog series will focus on an individual marmot, so you can understand a bit more about the team who are busy bringing the Monax vision to life. Next up is one of our newest recruits, Chenxaio Hu Wu from Team Success, based in Edinburgh:

### Hey Chenxaio, can you introduce yourself in a sentence?

I’m big fan of food, all things pink, naps and travel - oh, and cats. Don’t forget the cats! And the unicorns and rainbows, come to think of it…

### How did you cross paths with Monax?

Fate. As a complete newbie in the techy world, was researching a bit about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and of course, blockchain, and ended up applying for a non-techy position in this amazing startup.

### What’s your background?

Spanish-born-Chinese who, after lawyering over 3 years in different areas and different regions, realised there was plenty yet to discover in the professional world and decided to make the leap into the legaltech world.

### What does your work at Monax involve?

In short, to make the Monax platform super-accessible. I regularly test the continuously improving platform to ensure a smooth user journey experience for both producers and consumers. I also lead the internationalization of the platform by enabling the webapp in the two most widely used languages after English (Spanish and Chinese) and I also focus on the diversification of the participating law firms. Once the platform goes live,  I will mainly be helping producers transform their legal knowledge into legal products while teaching consumers how easy and simple it is to acquire high quality yet low cost and time-saving products using the Monax platform.[hyperlink to other setion on site]

### If you had to choose one aspect of our culture that best defines you, which  one would it be and why?

Multiculturality.

Monax is an open-minded company which different cultures people play together and conversations flow smoothly between different teams, while you still get to enjoy your personal passions.


This is the company value that also best defines me as an individual. I am committed to my community. I think when we engage others and encourage them to participate, the community gets stronger, both in terms of the commitment of members to each other and also in terms of the commitment of members to the community’s quality of life and the shared values that unite us.

### What challenges does your role bring and how do you meet them?

Everything is new to me -  the tech world, the role, working for a company where my mother tongue is not the first language… But the legal-tech world is fascinating and completely absorbing for me to learn more about it and about how tech can improve the world, so the trick is persistence, and the belief that with my contribution to the company I will be contributing my own little share of making the world a better place -at least the legal world-. And always, speaking with a colleague, they will help giving valuable ideas, and if not, there always is a friendly marmot hug.

### Tell us a quirky fact about yourself…

I am the munching and napping marmot. Little snacks must be on my desk at all times and one of the bean bags has my name on it. You will spot me by the pink laptop.
