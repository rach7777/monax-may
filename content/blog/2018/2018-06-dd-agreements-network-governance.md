Governance -- it's how we manage group activity and plan for a future full of change. In designing an open blockchain application, governance is a foundational issue that blurs the boundaries between tech, law and business. Effective self-governance in the [Agreements Network](https://agreements.network) (AN) is critical to its role as infrastructure on which modern legal products operate.

> A resilient decentralized governance system requires sound design from multiple perspectives.

> - It must provide methods for handling the day-to-day needs of platform operations.
> - It must provide mechanisms for dealing with change.
> - It must provide mechanisms for enforcement of governance rules.
> - It must be fair,trustworthy and represent the interests of all stakeholders, a non-zero-sum model.
> - It should utilize network resources in order to enforce community cohesion, e.g., reputation and ratings.


The Agreements Network carefully combines an open network, trusted validator nodes, voting, skin-in-game staking and token rewards to produce a forward-compatible environment that promotes ecosystem growth. The initial iteration of the governance structure is rooted in a commitment to Agreements Network integrity, our experience operating decentralized governance systems, and our drive to build resilient legal infrastructure for the modern economy.


## Governance Incentives and Mechanisms on the Agreements Network


In the Agreements Network, the basic tools for managing day-to-day operation of the blockchain are tokens and validator nodes. The same tokens are used as consideration for bonds and products on the Agreements Network.


## Token Mechanism

The Agreements Network requires "skin in the game" from many of its user groups. This promotes self-interest and reward for good work within the Agreements Network. People who seek to make money using the Agreements Network must have a stake in the health of the ecosystem in order to earn. In the blockchain-backed Agreements Network, this means acquiring tokens and placing them into a bond. This bond provides two functions to the network. First, it ensures that participants have "skin in the game" when they seek to make money within the context of the network. Second, it provides protection against spam in the Network.


Bonds require users to place Agreements Network tokens into contracts resembling machine-controlled escrow. The network uses bonds extensively within its token economics protocol. If the users follow the network's rules and later wish to receive their bond back, they may do so. If the users violate the Network's rules then they have a portion of their bond "slashed," or reduced. This bond is then distributed to the validator pool for platform.


Any user seeking to make money in the Network by building legal products needs to place a bond in the form of Agreements Network tokens before their products are added to the network. The number of tokens required to bond an Archetype is an asymptotic variable, a function of the total number of Archetypes within the system, calculated to enable the network to scale dramatically over time.

## Day-to-day Operations 


The day-to-day operational needs of the Agreements Network are performed by the Network Validators, known entities with proof of stake that operate Agreements Network blockchain nodes. Blockchain token functionality enables us to design liquidity, incentive, evidence and automation processes that execute inexpensively and scale rapidly. Tokens are the means by which data is  transferred and proved in blockchain networks. We can give tokens valuable properties and move them in network commerce to create and enforce incentives to acquire tokens, run validator nodes, maintain operations and encourage healthy content production and consumption.

## Beyond Tokens: Reputation and the Marketplace


Archetype Producers have another mechanism of ensuring compliance with Agreements Network standards: reputation. Since Producers have "skin in game" and are known (either explicitly or pseudonymously), another method for Producers to increase their value proposition and earnings in the Network is through maintaining high standards of product quality. Tester results and popularity of an Archetype may increase the value proposition of its creator, creating a virtuous cycle of useful products.


## Long-term Governance and Change


The primary mechanism for managing Agreements Network priorities over time is voting. The voting mechanism is informed by traditional corporate governance structures, but reimagined for resilience in open, decentralized networks.  Voting power is a function of validator bonding tokens, i.e., skin in the game. Because the Agreements Network is designed and tooled with existing contract and regulatory structures ensures in mind, it encourages user compliance with expected protocols without overly prescribing or restricting user activities.

In my previous posts I have spoken about
[why Monax decided to pivot]({{< relref
"blog/2018/2018-04-26-monax-is-pivoting.md" >}})
away from being a horizontal
enterprise software provider, and also I spoke about
[what the Agreements
Network is]({{< relref "blog/2018/2018-04-27-introducing-agreements-network.md" >}}).

In this post I'd like to speak with some more depth about how the two major
types of users we envision can use the blockchain-based platform to make their
lives better.

The Agreements Network is:

> a decentralized contract management solution that uses smart contract
> technology to bring together producers and consumers of legal products

This means, at a fundamental level, that the blockchain platform -- and the
smart contracts that operate it -- are sitting across multiple participants
within the ecosystem. While the platform does much more than simply provide a
market place for forms, it does offer a connection point between traditional
marketplace actors: namely buyers and sellers. The outcome of the bargaining
relationship will operate within the context of the Network itself in terms of
an `Active Agreement`. In the below sections, I provide a high level overview of
how each of these two groups that are vital to the evolution of the Agreements
Network ecosystem can use the platform.

## The Agreements Network for Business Leaders

They say that in startup land one should focus on solving real problems you
actually face. And at Monax, we've taken that to heart in our work on the
Agreements Network. Since I left the practice of law, I've been running a small
business. A startup. This startup in fact. During this time I have faced
innumerable circumstances where we could have moved faster and made more money
if we had had something like the Agreements Network. Alas, it didn't exist: so
we had to create it!

Imagine a system where your sales folks could consume deal agreements that have
been crafted by legal and technology experts, and finally vetted by someone you
trust. Then imagine, that when your sales team concludes those agreements --
entirely electronically -- they can instantly trigger your accounting system to
fire off the initial invoice. Without your sales team member having to call an
accounts payable person (or, in startup land sending a slack message to the
CFO). Then the agreements can initiate a new project within your project
management system. Without your sales team member having to send a slack message
to a project manager. And when the project is completed, the project management
system can inform the agreement of the completion -- in turn triggering the
accounting system to fire off the end of project invoice. With a system like
that, connecting your high value business systems via rock-solid blockchain-held
evidence how much more money can you make (all while keeping your risk low!)?

The reason this is possible with blockchain based systems is that not only to
they provide collaborative notarization that a certain party said an event
occured, but they also provide an API that is not conceived by -- nor operated --
by a for profit company who can unilaterally decide to change it or turn it off.
Rather, the API is provided by a solid blockchain based ecosystem which cannot
be unilaterally changed.

Together these ideas allow for a huge swathe of amazingly exciting
possibilities. The combination of risk reducing, bite-size evidence collected in
a tamper-proof log with business process automation baked in via an unchangeable
API provides business leaders with the legal infrastructure they need to do more
deals, hire more people, and waste less time finding their paperwork.

## The Agreements Network for Lawyers

As I noted above, before I ran this startup I was a practicing attorney. More
precisely I was running my own law firm in a small jurisdiction in the Horn of
Africa doing a range of small business and governance work. During that time, I
was very interested in how I could make my own practice more efficient by using
technology. During this time it became clear that if I was every going to scale
my revenue, I had to leverage technology to do that. And yet, existing
technologies at the time could only take me so far. At some point I would end up
having to competing with the various forms libraries that exist on the internet.
I needed more. I needed a framework on which I could build relevant **legal
products** for today's business -- as well as tomorrow's.

Imagine, if you will, a platform on which you as a lawyer can securely upload
your legal contract templates, formally model the legally relevant business
processes which using consumers of your product must follow, set the price for
that product, and then sell it to anyone in the world with an internet
connection. That's what the Agreements Network does for legal folks.

In the coming weeks, we'll be walking through many more details about the
platform and how both legal products consumers and legal products producers can
both make more money and reduce the friction of modern, networked commerce. Stay
tuned for those posts, and in the meantime, please dig deeper into the
possibilities that the [Agreements Network allows](https://agreements.network).
