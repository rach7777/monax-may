#### The service gap for startups 

Chances are, if you are involved with a startup business you’re getting a raw deal on how you form and manage your contracts. In terms of quality legal services at a reasonable price that reflect the value delivered to startups, there is a definite gap in the current market. 

On one hand, there is a raft of companies offering ‘off the shelf’ contracts which have little or no guidance or dynamism. Crucially, from a business perspective they offer the bare minimum of legal protection. Should things go wrong down the line, litigation lawyers often find rich pickings due to the poorly considered use of such forms. 

On the other hand, there is the very real issue of notoriously expensive and time-sucking contractual deals. These are particularly characteristic for tech startups, where each funding round can involve a legal outlay of extreme disproportion (costs typically ranging from 30-100k). To add insult to injury, the fees often need to be repeated for subsequent funding rounds when the previous set of documents would have provided a reasonable baseline upon which to build up a deal. 

#### The need for a middle ground 


It’s clear there is no viable middle ground currently serving the startup model - nothing with the requisite quality and agility which the very nature of startup land demands. To amplify this problem, the middle sphere of modern commerce is experiencing exponential growth. In other words, there is a huge unmet need. 

#### Making startup life easier

With the Monax Platform there is a new middle way for startups to implement and manage their legal affairs, solving the issues described above and many more. So, how does it work?  The consumer, for example a startup CEO, is about to hire a bunch of staff and wants to create several contracts of employment. They log on to the Monax platform, search the marketplace for these contracts and select the one most appropriate for their needs. They then fill out the blank sections that the lawyer who produced the template has set up, and click go. The documents themselves are held in storage, while hashes of the documents and evidence of their provenance are stored in a blockchain for easy access and control tomorrow. Next, a suite of business processes are set in motion and subsequently tracked. This allows any parties within the system (in our case, the CEO and his prospective employee) to be prompted to fulfil a particular event at a particular time. The requirement for an employment contract might be uploading ID, evidence of degree certificate and of course signing. The interface looks like this:

### The Monax difference

The process above might not appear to be vastly different from using an off-the-shelf legal form library, but it creates a easier way to manage and track legal obligations. The value lies in the ability to manage legal obligations in a more dynamic way, streamline processes and keeping all important documents for a future due diligence in one place. This represents a step change from the standard functionality (fill out a form, download a PDF, sign by hand, scan and email to the counterparty). Not only do you have the ability to fill out forms, you can now track every event related to the contract lifecycle and, better still, these events are indelibly recorded on a blockchain. This represents a paradigm shift in getting legal certainty without legal hassle.
