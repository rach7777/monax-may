In our last legal engineering blog, we discussed a basic building block of a secure, automated supply chain: a 4-way match of purchase order, invoice, shipping documents and inspection. In this entry, we begin to put that building block into context in an integrated supply chain design using Monax’s legal product modeler.

The supply chain is an ecosystem made up of diverse actors, each performing a specific role to get a simple job done: move goods in commerce. Participants include raw materials suppliers, manufacturers, shippers, sellers and consumers, to name a few, plus the many financial and risk and legal services associated with doing business around the globe. A legal product design must meet the needs of all the participants at once.

Time to get creative! Building on the core principle of a 4-way match, we can begin to construct a more sophisticated workflow that integrates  physical, regulatory, financial, and risk operations via digital legal products.  A high-level example might include the following defaults, which may be customized to suit the needs of a given vertical.

In such an integrated system Active Agreements, Archetypes and workflows connect to execute as seamlessly as practical when dealing with physical goods. In addition, Active Agreements can more easily and quickly interface with permissioned outside systems at critical points. For example, once a purchase order is approved, it is automatically added to cash forecasting. Tight evidence and title of electronic chattel paper mean that post-shipment financing, like trade receivables, becomes more attractive and feasible in global commerce. An integrated supply chain is a prime example of the use of legal products in networked economies, and a great illustration of the potential unleashed when legal agreements can “talk to each other.”

Cool idea! How do get it done? Here’s where design thinking, legal engineering and the Monax legal process modeler come in.

Getting started.

Pick a starting point. While sometimes it makes sense to start at the beginning, in a solution as complex and variable as the supply chain, it’s often better to pick a pain point with finite inputs, outputs and metrics of success. That way, ecosystem design evolution is agile, iterative, and capable of evolving quickly in a rapidly changing world. As an example, building on the 4-way supply chain match, we can model how an Active Agreement turns a moment in a contract lifecycle, purchase order approval, into reliable, actionable, cash forecasting.

Modeling tools to turn legal contracts into Active Agreements.

To build an Active Agreement that communicates with cash forecasting utilities, we begin with a basic Purchase Order Archetype, which consists of a prose template, a set of parameters, a formation workflow (buyer places purchase order) and an execution workflow (seller approves purchase order). The cash forecast message adds an additional execution step to the archetype: sending a verified message about terms and conditions to cash forecasting.

Voila, one more step in the integrated supply chain executed!

In the next Monax legal engineering post, we look at another supply chain solution particularly suited to Active Agreements: trade finance receivables.
