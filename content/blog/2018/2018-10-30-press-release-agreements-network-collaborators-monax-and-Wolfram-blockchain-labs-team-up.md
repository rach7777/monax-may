### LONDON (PRWEB) OCTOBER 30, 2018

Monax, a leader in open-source blockchain technology, today announced it is teaming up with one of its [Agreements Network](https://www.agreements.network) collaborators, [Wolfram Blockchain Labs](https://www.wolframblockchainlabs.com) to create infrastructure for networked, computable contracts.

This framework will connect precise, verified off-chain computational knowledge with legal products and operations. Relevant computational knowledge includes a variety of computable data streams from a variety of scientific, financial and environmental sources that impact the performance of legal obligations. The Network is an open blockchain ecosystem for the creation, distribution and operation of legal agreements, which is redefining how legal products and services support the networked economy. The combination of legal product infrastructure and reliable, easily assembled information will enable new products and solutions across the networked economy, iterating faster and scaling more smoothly.

“[Wolfram](http://www.wolfram.com) is the foremost computational intelligence company, and its subsidiary Wolfram Blockchain Labs is emerging as one of the most dynamic blockchain tech companies,” stated Casey Kuhlman, CEO of Monax. “It is truly exciting that users of the Agreements Network will have unparalleled access to authenticated information.”

“Our collaboration with Monax allows us to build new infrastructure and bring computational intelligence to all users of the Agreements Network,” stated Jon Woodard, of Wolfram Blockchain Labs.

Monax recently announced the release of the first business process engine written entirely in the Solidity smart contract language. The firm also announced a high-level API that allows users to input standardized Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) files and translate them into suitable instructions that can be operated by the full-featured and extensively-tested smart contract-based engine. Monax is leveraging this engine as a core component of the Network, which is set to transform the delivery of legal services and promote productization of law.
With the growth of the networked economy, devices and digital commerce, legal functions need to be embedded within the software driving transactions. The open-source nature of blockchains and standards like BPMN support the evolution of a framework for building broad access to legal tools, products and services to achieve business goals and objectives.

Using the Network, lawyers and companies can design and operate templates and contracts to perform legal jobs, such as contract management and collecting, storing and proving evidence. If your company would like to participate in upcoming cofounder cohorts that will further the effort toward the launch of the network, please visit: https://agreements.network/ to learn how to get involved. The website also provides information about how the Network operates, what it does and the technical specifics of running a node.

#### About Monax 
Monax was co-founded in 2014 by Casey Kuhlman. The firm built a market-leading, free and open-source universal blockchain platform on which anyone can construct their own secure, low-cost, run-anywhere applications using blockchain and smart contract technology. In April 2018, Monax became one of the founding companies behind the Agreements Network, a decentralized blockchain-powered contract management platform for small and medium enterprises. The Network allows anyone to develop, customize, sell and reproduce legal products. Monax is headquartered in London and has offices in Edinburgh and New York.
