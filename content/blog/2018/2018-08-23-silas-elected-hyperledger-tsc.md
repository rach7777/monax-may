We are extremely please to announce that our Chief Technical Officer, Silas Davis, has been elected to the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC). This is great news both for Monax but more importantly for the entire Hyperledger Burrow community. Silas will now be able to provide a voice of the Ethereum and Burrow communities directly on the Hyperledger TSC.

We think that it is essential for any collaborative organization to have a wide diversity of members for it's various steering and governance bodies. As the only current member of the TSC who is from a startup and one of the few members of the TSC not primarily focused on a large company implementation of either Fabric or Sawtooth, we are excited about bringing a different perspective to the TSC to help guide matters and decisions through.

Joining him are the following fine folks:

| Name | Employer | Primary System |
|---|---|---|
| Arnaud Le Hors | IBM  | Fabric  |
| Baohua Yang  | Oracle | Cello / Fabric  |
|  Binh Nguyen | State Street  | Fabric  |
| Christopher Ferris  | IBM  | Fabric  |
| Dan Middleton  | Intel  | Sawtooth  |
| Kelly Olson  | Intel  | Sawtooth  |
|  Mic Bowman |  Intel | Sawtooth  |
| Nathan George  | Sovrin Foundation  | Indy  |
|  Hart Montgomery | Fujitsu  |  White Paper WG / crypto-lib |
| Mark Wagner  | RedHat  | Labs / Caliper / Performance & Scalability WG  |

As marmots we look forward to working with the entire Hyperledger community to further the fine efforts which have begun by previous TSC's.
