### Monax attend 'the biggest party in legal tech'

Legal Geek's events are always top of the list for the UK-based marmots, and this year was no exception. Eight of us gathered in London to meet other like-minded folks and learn of the great things happening in legal-tech land.
The motto of this most unique of law tech events is “Friends First, Business After” and we came away having made some great new friends and feeling super-energised about the coming months here at MonaxHQ.

We were proud to be one of only four ‘Featured Startups’ this year, and had a great time chatting to what seemed like hundreds of enthusiastic faces about both the [Agreements Network](https://agreements.network) and the Monax Platform. Our tagline ‘What if your agreements could talk to each other?’ certainly piqued people’s interest and sparked lots of great conversations. Curious? Find out more [here](https://monax.io/blog/2018/08/21/example-active-agreement-workflows-and-interfaces/).

Our hero-marmot of the day had to be [Chenxiao](https://monax.io/blog/2018/10/05/meet-the-marmots-chenxiao-hu-wu-producer-experience-associate/) who not only did a presentation on stage 2 (see below) but spent hours excitedly walking folks through the new demo environment which the development team built especially for the event (thanks guys!). As a side note, Chenxiao is our producer experience associate and she's currently on the lookout for awesome Monax brand ambassadors - more info [here](https://monax.io/blog/2018/10/17/love-monax-love-marmots-become-an-mba-monax-brand-ambassador/).

It wasn’t just UK marmots at the event - our CCO, Nina Kilbride, flew in from the US especially, and was a highlight of the afternoon’s main stage with her talk - if you missed out, the slides are available [here].

All in all, we had a fantastic day with so many curious folks passing the stand, intrigued by the question on the front of our leaflets:
“What if your agreements could talk to each other?”
The event was attended by over 2000 people and needless to say, we can’t wait to be involved next year! Here’s some of the photo highlights and the official event video, courtesy of Legal Geek!
