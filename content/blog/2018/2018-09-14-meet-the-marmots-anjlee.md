Monax is bursting at the seams with talent from both tech, legal and business.  Our team is split between offices in London,  Edinburgh and New York - and a few remote marmots too!

We’re a diverse bunch of characters, and work hard to bring about the future of legal tech (and we have a lot of fun doing so!). Each post in this blog series will focus on an individual marmot, so you can understand a bit more about the team who are busy bringing the Monax vision to life. First up is one of our newest recruits, Anjlee Khurana from Team Legal Engineering:

### Hey Anjlee, can you introduce yourself in a sentence?

I’m a loyal art lover, family member, and friend.

### How did you cross paths with Monax?

I have known CEO, Casey Kuhlman, since law school.

### What’s your background?

I spent the last ten years practicing entertainment law in Nashville, and before that I  studied at  Columbia University for undergrad and Vanderbilt law school (where I bumped into Casey).

### What does your work at Monax involve?

Product-market fit.

### If you had to choose one aspect of our culture that best defines you, which  one would it be and why? 

Committed to ‘team human’ (and ‘team marmot’) 

This is the company value that also best defines me as an individual. I am committed to my community. I think when we engage others and encourage them to participate, the community gets stronger, both in terms of the commitment of members to each other and also in terms of the commitment of members to the community’s quality of life and the shared values that unite us.

### What challenges does your role bring and how do you meet them?

As an attorney I was surrounded by lack of tech and lack of interest in tech. In that crowd, I was often the advanced member tutoring others in using tech. I am now surrounded by tech that goes way over my head! Learning is fun, so it’s not a difficult challenge to meet, even if it is a challenge in the sense that I need to conquer the unknown.

### Tell us a quirky fact about yourself…

One of my legs is longer than the other.


### Thank you so much Anjlee!

*The word ‘Monax’ comprises part of the binomial name for a groundhog (marmota monax) and our company mascot is a rock n’ roll marmot called Doug. Folks who work for Monax traditionally refer to themselves as marmots, and no prizes for guessing how we came up with the name [Hyperledger Burrow](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-burrow)!
