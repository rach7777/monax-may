Legal. It's most often thought of as a bad word. But a necessary word nonetheless.

There are, historically, a range of reasons for this, but there is one in particular that I'd like to explore in the context of this post: delivery. Ho]w "legal" is delivered is a pain. It's a pain point for both the suppliers of "legal" as well as the demanders of "legal". Let's take a closer look.

## Legal Departments: The Final Frontier for Digital

If we survey the functional areas of nearly any business we are very likely to find something telling. Across those functional areas legal will be the least digitized amongst all of them. This survey will not hold for every single business, but for the most part it holds true across vertical sectors and business sizes. Smaller businesses all the way up to the largest businesses have legal functions which are -- at their core -- non-digitized.

While it is true that lawyers know very well how to email Word documents between and amongst themselves; and while it is also true that a great many lawyers know their way around Word better than many other professions; it is not necessarily the case that this renders legal "digital". So for the purposes of this post, let me classify what I mean when I say digital. Here I mean, the implementation of operational systems which are capable of machine level automation and machine level integrations with other systems. Word documents emailed across do not qualify.

As the world moves ever further down the path of digitization the legal functions of most businesses are being forced to migrate and update their systems. This is, fundamentally, a good thing. It will eventually reduce errors, increase certainty, decrease risk, and streamline operations at a core level.

Why has it taken so long? Our hypothesis at Monax is not that lawyers are technological cretins. Indeed, in our experience lawyers are not out of band *vis a vis* other professions. When we think about the transactional practice of law in particular, our predominant working hypothesis is that there has been a core technological feature suite missing that has significantly hindered the digitization of legal. See legal is different than other business functions because it provides the fundamental component for a business's interactions with other businesses. Everything that accounting, purchasing, manufacturing, and others do is -- for the most part -- the result of a contract (or agreement) that the legal function of the business is responsible for. In other words, legal operates as the drawbridge between "our" business and other businesses. In previous generations of technology there has been no fundamental infrastructural component which can operate such a drawbridge between businesses. Computer programs ran on "your" computers or on "my" computers. They never were ran on both of our computers. And as we've [written elsewhere](/learn/ecosystem_applications) this -- at its core -- is the key value proposition that blockchain technology has to offer.

So, if we take away the technical limitation what is left? Opportunity. A hell of a lot of opportunity. Opportunity to build legal operations tools, platforms, and applications that meet the needs of today's (and tomorrow's) businesses. In other words, **legal products**. The needs that these legal products must meet are both varied and deep.

While it is true that legal operation functions haven't truly digitized; it is not true that business models haven't evolved drastic new paradigms. We see in the market a ebbing divide between market pressures and what bespoke legal services are capable of providing to the market.

Everywhere one looks networked business models are thriving. These business models neither fit nicely within the old contracts of adhesion model where a big business "tells" its customers what to get, nor within the old highly bespoke customized contracts. Indeed these business models sit somewhere between these extremes if we were to graph them on a spectrum. They are somewhat bespoke, but require participation by multiple parties in the execution and operation of the agreement.

But who will create these new **legal products**?

## Legal Providers: In Existential Crisis

On the other side of the typical legal "transaction" we have providers of legal services. We also, typically, call these law firms. The data is clear: legal services providers are in the midst of an existential crisis. Revenues per lawyer and productivity per lawyer are flat. And have been for nearly a decade. Growth opportunities are stagnant. And have been for nearly a decade. Research after research has shown that there is a foundational problem for law firms that want to grow their bottom line.

The diagnosis for why this is, is not as clear however. There is data showing that revenue for firms is being sent to non-firms (typically known as alternative legal services providers) or being pulled in-house. There is data showing that buyers of legal services are under budgetary pressures to reduce spend and are engaging differently with law firms than they did previously (typically known as alternative fee arrangements).

All those may be true, but they miss the point. One isn't going to get leverage behind employee's time if one's business model is fundamentally a consulting model.

And this is the crucial point that, in my opinion, most of the pundits miss. If one's business model is limited to a consulting business model then one is never going to get leverage behind what you do. There are only so many hours in your consultant's days; there are only so many (associates, partners, of-counsels) consultants you can employ. Finally, consulting isn't sticky. There is typically little to nothing beyond a personal relationship that drives purchasing decisions of consulting services or impedes the movement from one consulting firm to another.

We aren't alone in this hypothesis. A range of forward thinking firms are starting to realize that the consulting business model can -- and should -- be augmented with other business models that are capable of getting more leverage behind what they are doing.

And this -- along with a range of new, user-focused legal tech startups (such as, ahem, us) -- is where the **legal products** of the future are likely to come from.
