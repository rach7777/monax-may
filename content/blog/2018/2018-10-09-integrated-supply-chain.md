# Integrating the physical, financial and regulatory supply chain with Active Agreements

In a recent [legal engineering blog post](https://monax.io/blog/2018/09/11/solving-problems-with-active-agreements-supply-chain-fraud./), I discussed a basic building block of a secure, automated supply chain: four-way match of purchase order, invoice, shipping documents and inspection. These are the typical fulfillment contracts for supply chain transactions around the globe. In this entry, we begin to put the four-way match into context in an integrated supply chain design using Monax’s legal product modeler.

**Time to get creative!** Building on the core principle of a 4-way match, we can begin to construct a more sophisticated workflow that integrates  physical, regulatory, financial, and risk operations via digital legal products.

The supply chain is an ecosystem made up of diverse actors, each performing a specific role to get a simple job done: move goods in commerce. Participants include raw materials suppliers, manufacturers, shippers, sellers and consumers, to name a few, plus the many financial, risk and legal services associated with doing business around the globe. A solid supply chain design should meet the needs of all the participants at once.

 A high-level example might include the following defaults, which may be customized to suit the needs of a given vertical. In such an integrated system Active Agreements, templates and workflows connect to execute as seamlessly as practicable when dealing with physical goods. In addition, Active Agreements can more easily and quickly interface with permissioned outside systems at critical points. For example, once a purchase order is approved, it is automatically added to cash forecasting for instant insight.

An integrated supply chain is a prime example of the use of legal products in networked economies, and a great illustration of the potential unleashed when legal agreements can “talk to each other.” Tight digital evidence structures, and the provable control they give to data, for example, chain of custody and title of electronic chattel paper, means that supply chain financing becomes more attractive and feasible for more participants.

Cool idea! How do get it done? Here’s where design thinking, legal engineering and the Monax legal process modeler come in.

## Monax Legal Product Modeler turns legal contracts into Active Agreements.

**Pick a starting point.** While sometimes it makes sense to start at the beginning, in a solution as complex and variable as the supply chain, it’s often simpler to pick a pain point with finite inputs, outputs and metrics of success. That way, ecosystem design is agile, iterative, and capable of evolving quickly in a rapidly changing world. As an example, building on the 4-way supply chain match, we can model how an Active Agreement turns a moment in a contract lifecycle (in this instance, purchase order approval) into reliable, actionable, cash forecasting, as reflected in the integrated supply chain diagram above.

Cash flow forecasting enables a business to predict and manage its revenue and investment needs. By giving an instant window on approval of purchase orders, an automated smart cash forecasting report can help businesses plan better and operate more efficiently.

To build an Active Agreement that communicates with cash forecasting utilities, we begin with a basic purchase order Archetype, which consists of a prose template, a set of parameters, a formation workflow (buyer places purchase order) and an execution workflow (seller approves purchase order). The cash forecast message adds an additional execution step to the archetype: sending a verified message about terms and conditions to the cash forecasting recipient. Digital legal processes and proof mean the cash forecast has reliable foundations and can support good business decisions.

Voila, one more step in the integrated supply chain executed!

In the next Monax legal engineering post, we look at another supply chain solution particularly suited to Active Agreements: trade finance, including post-invoice finance, trade receivables finance and factoring.
