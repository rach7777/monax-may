Monax have been busy building, and as we edge closer to the launch of both the [Agreements Network](https://agreements.network) and the Monax Platform (a user-friendly gateway to the Agreements Network), the press are taking a lot of interest in what we have to say.

Below is a collection of print, online and broadcast news featuring both the company and our Chief Marmot/CEO, Casey Kuhlman. This blog will be updated regularly so please check back to keep up with our mentions (if you are a journalist reading this, feel free to email press@monax.io for any stories or quotes - we are always happy to talk Monax!)
