We’re on the hunt for some awesome marmot-friendly humans to spread the word about all things Monax! Our brand ambassador programme is being setup to create an official role for Monax evangelists, and to grow our tribe of marmots across the globe!

The programme is cunningly known as the MBA. While we can’t guarantee the C-level job that slogging away in business school for that other MBA might bring, we can guarantee a bunch of privileges and (of course!) marmoty fun! 

At Monax we are building products which we intend to instigate great change in the world of legal. We truly believe things can be done differently, that everyone deserves proper legal protection while spending less and generating revenue. Our mission is to introduce legal as a product, and thus transform the current contracting landscape. Needless to say we have some really exciting projects afoot!

We have a vibrant online community of brand ambassadors, just as excited about Monax as we are. There is always room for more! Do you fit the bill? You could be involved in the legal industry either as a professional or a student, or simply someone who is a fan of Monax and digs what we do. Either way, you will be keen to get involved in helping people understand and use the Monax platform (and you must be a lover of marmots, naturally).

We want marmots from all around, with one simple mission - to tell the world about Monax through all kinds of chat, be it social media, face-to-face in your local pub or at industry-wide events etc. There will be some awesome perks for those who successfully apply. 

We’re currently finalising the full programme and benefits, and hope to launch things real soon, so if you want to be one of the first to find out please reach out to our MBA lead marmot, [Chenxiao](https://monax.io/blog/2018/10/05/meet-the-marmots-chenxiao-hu-wu-producer-experience-associate/) contact.monax.io.

Happy contracting!
