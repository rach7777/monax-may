EDINBURGH - November 8, 2018 - Casey Kuhlman, CEO of Monax, a leader in open-source blockchain technology, has been accepted into the Forbes Technology Council. The Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs, and technology executives.

Kuhlman was vetted and selected by a review committee based on the depth and diversity of his experience. Criteria for acceptance include a track record of successfully impacting business growth metrics, as well as personal and professional achievements and honors. 

“We are honored to welcome Casey into the community,” said Scott Gerber, founder of Forbes Councils, the collective that includes Forbes Technology Council. “Our mission with Forbes Councils is to bring together proven leaders from every industry, creating a curated, social capital-driven network that helps every member grow professionally and make an even greater impact on the business world.”

As an accepted member of the Council, Kuhlman has access to a variety of exclusive opportunities designed to help him reach peak professional influence. He will connect and collaborate with other respected local leaders in a private forum. Kuhlman will also be invited to work with a professional editorial team to share his expert insights in original business articles on Forbes.com, and to contribute to published Q&A panels alongside other experts. 

Finally, Monax will benefit from exclusive access to vetted business service partners, membership-branded marketing collateral, and the high-touch support of the Forbes Councils member concierge team. 

“I am honored to be asked to join the Forbes Technology Council and its rich industry community,” stated Kuhlman. “I intend to participate as fully as possible to raise awareness of what we are building at Monax, and to continue raising the importance of blockchain technology to the legal industry.”
