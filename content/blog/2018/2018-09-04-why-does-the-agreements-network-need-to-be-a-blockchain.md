This is part of a blog series taking a look at the Monax Platform from a non-tech perspective. The system has many layers of technology but can be accessed by those who don’t code amongst us. Here we unpick one of the foundation elements: the fact that the [Agreements Network](https://agreements.network/) (on which the Monax Platform is based) uses a [blockchain](https://monax.io/learn/blockchains/).

#### The Dinosaur

You’re possibly reading this post after hearing in a bunch of conflicting news about blockchains, much of which tends to focus on their financial aspect - the perennial ‘what price is Bitcoin today?’ question for example. There are tales of mass corruption, or of seemingly impossible gains from investing in this or that particular coin.

At Monax, we focus on what blockchain technology is capable of delivering to the business world. Monax is, as CEO Casey often puts it, ‘a dinosaur in the blockchain space’. We were the first company to turn our focus on how blockchain technology could apply to real-world business problems, and we’ve remained a do-leader in the space.

Over our journey, it became apparent that the application of blockchain could elegantly solve many real-world business problems. The key aspect of what blockchains can do is to solve problems of business coordination. Metaphorically a blockchain is like the soil from which organisations feed and interact in an web of equal dependencies.

#### The Ecosystem

Many who are new to the technology often ask what’s the point in using a blockchain when a database will do? The key difference is that a database doesn’t allow several unique businesses to perform and maintain transactions over a set of data controlled by all of them more or less equally - in a secure environment. In a standard database, a business can change entries in its database by updating the master copy on a server owned by that business. But until now, there was no way to collaboratively run a data management solution across companies.

When we use a blockchain to run our transactions on, there’s a data and events infrastructure which can then be managed collectively. Parties can share information without the constraints of a centralised administrator - the technology processes transactions of the network of parties using what’s known as a consensus mechanism - essentially, everyone in the system shares the same records simultaneously. This new collaborative infrastructure is the blockchain ecosystem, an underlying layer for new business models to emerge.

#### Yours or Mine?

In the past, there was an issue with running contracts collaboratively on computer systems - most obviously due to the question of whose system the contracts should be held on. I don’t want the contract to run only on your computer, and likewise you don’t want it to run on mine. There simply wasn’t a way to bridge this technological gap. Blockchain allows this collaborative ecosystem to take place - for the first time in history, we have a data and events infrastructure which can be managed by all parties simultaneously. This is of particular benefit to legal functions, given that legal is an interface point across companies. We have a real need for blockchain technology to build the technical foundation on which to digitise legal.

#### The Blueprint for Trust

The blockchain ecosystem gives all users the ability to verify events, have visibility on whether an event has occurred and to recall the history of any particular event. This digitisation of transactions allows for a unique blueprint for trust which can be applied to many business situations. Let’s look at this from a legal example: when something goes wrong in the course of a business contract, a huge amount of time and money can be spent digging out papers, pulling PDFs that have been documented in various states of organisation, and then building an evidence dossier to hold up the claim. Imagine if all of the paperwork and evidence was at your fingertips, complete with a transparent record of who did what, when notarized by an ecosystem of non-interested (in that particular contract) parties who had no reason to lie about any of these events?

#### The Anti-Hype

Monax have harnessed blockchain technology to bring real change to the business world, rather than to participate in the current hype train and lose sight of the immense power these new technologies open up to us. We have been working in the blockchain space since 2014 and our previous platform, Eris, was adopted by major banks and professional service companies . Monax have also built [Hyperledger Burrow](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-burrow), a fast and easy to get to grips with blockchain framework. We are a head’s down company - delivering value is our priority here at Monax HQ!

The next blog post in this series will cover Active Agreements which are the exciting next step in the evolution of contracting.
