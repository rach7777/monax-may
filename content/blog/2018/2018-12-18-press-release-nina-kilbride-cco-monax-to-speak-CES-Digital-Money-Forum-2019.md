During her presentation, Kilbride will discuss how Monax built a platform meant to help a variety of users, including the creators and operators of electronic devices at CES, succeed in the digital revolution by leveraging legal products, operations and knowledge.
 
The Digital Money Forum at CES 2019 is a one-day conference that focuses on the transformation of money to digital currencies. It is held during CES, which provides attendees with a look at some of the hottest new products in the consumer electronics and devices market, which have great synergy with fintech, crypto, blockchain and Initial Coin Offering communities. The forum will take place on January 8, 2019 at The Venetian Las Vegas.
 
Monax built a market-leading, free and open-source universal blockchain platform on which anyone can construct their own secure, low-cost, run-anywhere applications using blockchain and smart contract technology. In April 2018, the firm became a cofounder of the Agreements Network, a decentralized blockchain-powered contract management platform for small and medium enterprises. The Network allows users to develop, customize, sell and reproduce legal products and transforms static contract forms into living active agreements.
