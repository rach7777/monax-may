One of the nice things about living in the Netherlands, despite having to run a London hwadquareted company, with office in Berlin and New York and the travel such an arrangement involves, is that the trains are some of the best I've ever experienced.




Ironically the Dutch love to complain about their train system.




At Eris we day we are automating our data driven relationships.




This post will provide a rough descriptor of my (outsiders view) take on what data driven relationships train companies may have.




Maintenance.
People.
Chipkart.
State incentives.
Capital.




Trains are interesting cause they are basically semi public companies. This gives us a chance to leverage the transparency aspects of chains rather than trying to force privacy efforts which are a bit away.





I'm here.
