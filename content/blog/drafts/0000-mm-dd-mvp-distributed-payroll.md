Getting your employees paid. Should be the primary job for any startup executive suite. Of course everyone wants to get their folks paid.

Work remote. Work from where you wanna work. It's the dream of the distributed working camps. The hope of the [DAO-ists]().

But how to reconcile these strands? How to make the work from where you wanna work... well. work.

# The Problem

At eris we run a distributed company. When we were at five FTE we were situated in the following countries: the Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom (our HQ), and Canada (during this time we also had contractors in South Africa and the US/Argentina -- depending on the week). We are now at nine FTE and we are currently situated in the following countries: the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (our HQ), Germany, Canada, the United States (we also have contractors in the US and Russia). For various reasons, this posture and positioning, geographically makes sense for our business.

What doesn't make sense, though, is the amount of work that this puts on us. In general it makes pretty good sense for a small business to optimize its resource spends around driving as much customer value as it can. This means, fundamentally, that operation and administration costs need to be kept low. Of course there are a lot of things which drive up administrative costs if you want to enable a distributed team, which is necessary to address the global markets available to truly information age organizations. But for this post I would like to focus in on payroll.

Essentially, the problem I'm using as the base for the remainder of this think piece is: `how can "we" reduce costs of payroll and payroll compliance using smart contract and blockchain technology?`

# The Base Theory

The first step in leveraging this tech towards a a better way of managing a small business's data driven relationships is to [identify the UI of Income Tax](https://medium.com/design-matters-4/the-ui-of-income-tax-e4a28691451#.85296q7b3) (by Eris advisor Dave Galbraith). What Dave did in that article is he mapped out what the major cost buckets for deductions were in any country. This would be fantastic information which would be easily consumable in cryptographical signatures+ledgers lands and would be one necessary element to build a true ecosystem.

But just having raw numbers of 27% social tax deduction from employees who make X (pounds,euros,dollars,loonies) per month(anum?) is only a predicate. A base of information which I do need. But to actual get somewhere interesting one still must overcome two challenges.

**Challenge 1** -- Where are the edge cases?

And let's be honest. If it's tax there are gonna be edge cases.

**Challenge 2** -- How's the money moving?

And let's be honest. If my "bank" was an actual platform for my financial services needs which I could plug into with verifiable data and be able to let my data managing robots send payment instructions on my behalf, that might actually make for an interesting world.

# Diving Deeper







I'm pretty sure (this argument) also holds in the NGO world where there is constant downward pressure on administration and compliance costs.
