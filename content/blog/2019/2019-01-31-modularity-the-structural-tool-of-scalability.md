**Modularity**

As an organizational structure, modularity is a tool available to every endeavor. Modularity here refers to being composed of distinct units that accomplish distinct functions and that can be reused to fulfill the same function in other instances. These units become versatile building blocks for a wide variety of possible compositions.

Where there is modularity, there is structural ease and fluidity. Malfunction is more easily contained to the unit where it occurs and select units that bear dependent functions. Repair is often reduced to the replacement of malfunctioning unit. Structures can more easily adapt to changing knowledge and circumstances to the extent that adaptation can be expressed as a change in the composition of the whole. By retaining structural units and reapplying them, modularity allows us to constantly expand our toolkit.

The concept of modularity can be applied to the organizational structure of pretty much anything, whether it be a tech product, the human capital of company, or the production of a high school play. At Monax, we want to help our users take full advantage of the concept of modularity because we want to empower them to get the most out of our product.

**Modularity in the context of the Monax Platform:**

Monax provides a tool that enables the creation of legal products: we call it the Monax [Legal Product Studio](https://monax.io/blog/2018/11/22/introducing-the-monax-legal-product-studio/). The concept of modularity has already been applied in the law. For example, practitioners use and develop individual provisions that can be used in any number of agreements, like provisions on confidential information or indemnification. Similarly, practitioners use and develop templates that can be filled in to apply to different sets of facts.

With the [Monax Platform](https://monax.io/blog/2018/12/04/introducing-the-monax-platform---contract-lifecycle-management-for-the-digital-age/), templates are elevated from static documents to active digital engines. The traditional static legal document is parameterized to give it machine readability and then coupled with a [business process model](https://monax.io/blog/2018/09/25/introducing-the-monax-bpmn-engine---the-powerhouse-for-legal-products./) that provides a visual map of how to perform the terms contained in the written document. Processes can be divided into distinct modular sequences that can be copied and pasted from one model to another. 

Business process models are easier to read and operate more efficiently when assembled in clear, bite-sized pieces that describe how complex events including multiple actors can be orchestrated and harmonized. Modular design promotes easy iteration of common legal processes across multiple domains. For example, a repeated payment process like rent can be made into a loop that runs precisely the number of times that you set it to run. The payment loop shown below can be copied out of one model and quickly integrated into another.


Using loops for repeatable processes not only simplifies the model’s comprehensibility; it also results in a more efficient use of the platform’s resources. In addition to increasing the model’s modularity, the reduction in tasks and sequences has made the model less taxing for our system to run.

In February the [Monax Platform](https://monax.io/platform/) enters public beta, and there's lots more in the pipeline, the most significant being the launch of the [Agreements Network](https://agreements.network) later this year. Interested to hear how the platform can save you time and money, and give you complete oversight of your buisness contracting? Monax CCO Nina kilbride gives the lowdown in this [video](https://youtu.be/8yTzIKc0KdM) from her recent appearance at CES in Las Vegas. Our packages are laid out [here](https://monax.io/pricing/) and we open to Beta customers early February - be one of the first to try this innovative software.


**Happy contracting!**
