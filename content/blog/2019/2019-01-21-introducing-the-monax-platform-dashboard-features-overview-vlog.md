Vlog transcript: 

Hi this is [Chenxiao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenxiaoh/) from Monax, today's video blog will be about our dashboard features. 

Once you log in you will land in this overview page:

`MP Platform dashboard features`

- **Tasks** This is your obligational to-do list, here your legal obligations will be outlined for you to take care of. Keeping an eye on your obligations has never been easier!

- **Agreements** At a sight, how many agreements you are involved in and which is their legal state.

- **Collaborators** A list with the top five counterparties you have been signing your contracts with, keep an eye to whom you are doing your business with!

- **Frequently used templates** A shortcut to the templates you have been using the most.

Ok, so now you may wonder "But what does these information mean to me?"

That's why I built an example for you:

Let's imagine that I am professional photographer called Lucy:  
1. `Tasks` Will tell me when my signature is expected in a contract, and I will be notified when I need to take photographs for my clients.
2. `Agreements` I will be able to keep track on how many works I am about to sign up to deliver and how many works I've already committed to, helping me to organise my time more efficiently. 
3. `Collaborators` I can check quickly who are the businesses or individuals that hires me the most.
4. `Frequently used templates` Here, my most frequently used template is the independent contractor agreement I send to most clients. Each time I get a request for services I can easily access this document and send the customer an agreement that has all terms filled out and is ready for signing.

I hope this vlog has been clarifying, I'd love to hear your feedback, so feel free to drop me a message in the little chat bot in the bottom right corner. 

Thank you! 
Chenxiao
