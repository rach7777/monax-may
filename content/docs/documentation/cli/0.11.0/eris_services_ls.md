# eris services ls

Lists everything service related.

## Synopsis

Lists all: service definition files (--known), current existing containers
for each service (--existing), and current running containers
for each service (--running).

Known services can be started with the [eris services start NAME] command.
To install a new service, use [eris services import]. Services include
all executable services supported by the Eris platform which are
NOT blockchains or key managers.

Blockchains are handled using the [eris chains] command.

```bash
eris services ls
```

  -e, --existing   list all the all current containers which exist for a service
  -k, --known      list all the service definition files that exist
  -q, --quiet      machine parsable output
  -r, --running    list all the current containers which are running for a service
```

  -m, --machine string   machine name for docker-machine that is running VM (default "eris")
