## Solidity Series

<div class="note">
	<em>Note: As of 2017, our product has been renamed from Eris to Monax. This documentation refers to an earlier version of the software prior to this name change (<= 0.16). Later versions of this documentation (=> 0.17) will change the <code>eris</code> command and <code>~/.eris</code> directory to <code>monax</code> and <code>~/.monax</code> respectively.</em>
</div>

This sequence of tutorials assumes that you have an understanding of the `monax` tooling to the point we ended in our [101 tutorial sequence](/docs/getting-started/).


### Part 1: The Five Types Model

This is an introduction to systems of smart contracts. The purpose of these documents is to teach methods of writing large, scalable smart contract back-ends for ecosystem applications.

### Part 2: Action-Driven Architecture

The way contracts interact with each other is through the Doug contract. This is an illustration of a normal sequence of calls.

### Part 3: Solidity Language Features

In this tutorial we will cover some of the basic ones, types, interfaces, events, errors, and give a few examples of how these work in practice.

### Part 4: Testing Solidity

This post and the following ones will be about validating smart contracts; making sure that they do what they are designed to do, and that they continue to do so.

### Part 5: Modular Solidity

This post is about how we can divide contracts up into components. By creating smart contracts from a set of specialized super-contracts, it becomes easier to manage them, test them, and to build on previously written code.

### Part 6: Advanced Solidity Features

In this post we're going to look at some Solidity-features that are fairly new, tuples, memory arrays, libraries, index access/conversion between all types, and the new imports.

### Part 7: Updating Solidity Contracts

This tutorial series looks at modular systems of smart-contracts, and how to continuously update the code in a reliable way.
