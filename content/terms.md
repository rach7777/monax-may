## **Content you upload to the Monax Platform**
1. **Your licence to us.** You agree to grant us a fully paid-up, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable and sublicensable licence to access, store, copy, modify and otherwise use any of your User Data. User Data means all materials, data, information or other content:
  - that you load, transmit to or enter into the Monax Services (including Templates); and/or
  - that we collect from your usage of the Monax Services.
2. **How we can use your User Data.** You agree that we can use your User Data for the following purposes:
  - to make available, develop and enhance the Monax Services; and
  - to produce data, information or other materials that are not identified as relating to a particular individual or company, which is called "Anonymised Statistical Information".
We will not use your User Data for any purpose other than as set out above. However, we shall have the right to create, use, publish or otherwise disclose the Anonymised Statistical Information for any purpose and without any obligations to you of any kind.
3. **You are responsible for any personal data you upload or transmit via the Monax Platform.** You are responsible for ensuring that you only upload, transmit or otherwise use personal data (as defined in the applicable data protection legislation) via the Monax Services for which you have obtained the necessary consents or otherwise have a valid, legal basis for using.

## **Intellectual property rights**
1. **We own the Monax Platform and other related property.** All right, title and interest in and to any intellectual property rights in or arising out of or in connection with the Monax Platform (other than your User Data), the Anonymised Statistical Information (other than your User Data) and all other materials provided by us under this Contract, and all renewals and extensions thereof, shall belong to us.
2. **You own any Content you upload.**  All right, title and interest in and to any intellectual property rights in or arising out of or in connection with your User Data, and all renewals and extensions thereof, shall belong to you.

## **How we may use your personal information**
1. We will use any personal information you provide to us to:
  - provide the Monax Services;
  - inform you about other products or services that we provide, but you may stop receiving these at any time by contacting us.
2. Further details of how we will process your personal information are set out in the [Privacy Policy](/privacy).
3. **What the private and public settings mean in the Monax Platform.** It is important that you are aware of what the private and public settings mean in the Monax Platform and how they will apply differently BEFORE and AFTER the launch of the Agreements Network built to power the Monax Services After the full launch of the Agreements Network, private and public settings will function as follows. When you are creating Active Agreements in the Monax Platform, you can choose to either make your data “public” or “private”. Where you choose to make data public, this may be visible and accessible by third parties. Where you make data private, all data other than the parameters that dictate the workflow of the model will be encrypted and hashed and will only be accessible through an encryption key. That key will only be accessible to Monax, to you, and to anyone to whom you provide the key. Pending the full launch of the Agreements Network, private and public settings will function as follows. Where you choose to make data private, this data will not be generally accessible by third parties in the same way that public data will be. However, as Monax and our validators have access to the full ledger, we and they may be able to access and recreate your data. We will also always have a copy of your encryption key, but we will not use this to access your data unless you ask us to.

## **Limitation of liability**

## **Other important terms**
1. **We may transfer this agreement to someone else.** We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation. If we transfer this agreement in full, we will tell you in writing and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the Contract.
2. **You are not allowed to transfer your rights to someone else.** This Contract is personal to you and you must not transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person.
3. **Nobody else has any rights under this contract.** This Contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these Terms.
4. **If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force.** Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
5. **We can only vary the contract if we both agree in writing.** Any variation of the Contract only has effect if it is in writing and signed by you and us (or our respective authorised representatives).
6. **Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.** If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things in the given or in any other instance and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
7. **Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings.** If you are a business, any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with the Contract between us or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and the English courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any such dispute or claim.
