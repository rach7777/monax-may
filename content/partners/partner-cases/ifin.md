### The Company

Established in 1980, Ifin Sistemi is an italian software house active in the world of document management with a specific focus on sectors such as: financial-banking, large industrial companies and Public Administrations. Over the years Ifin Sistemi has earned a strong position in the market, mainly through its seriousness and competence.

Since 2000, the core business has become the management of electronic documents, document workflows and guaranteeing the consistency and legibility of documents and formats over time.

The main application fields where Ifin is leading (market share above 50%) since 2004 are the following: the management of the administrative/accounting data in the world of document outsourcing service centers and the digital preservation of radiological images in medical sector.

Since 2016 Ifin started working on the idea of extracting value from the blockchain and to server it as an advantage for its customers, Trust Service Providers (TSPs).


### Trust Service Providers

TSPs are highly qualified market operators with EU trust mark, appointed by European governmental agencies after a strict conformity assessment, in compliance with Regulation EU No. 910/2014 -eIDAS. They typically provide services such as: the creation, verification and validation of electronic signatures, seals, time stamps or digital certificates; and the management of electronic storage and archiving for documents. Long-term preservation of data, business continuity, high-level of security standards, privacy and confidentiality of transactions are essential factors for users, public administration and businesses, in order to develop reliable services and fully benefit from new technologies. Unlike other market operators which may run permissioned networks, TSPs are the only certified entities legally required to fulfil those conditions. Being highly regulated, they have a unique market position, with a unique kind of added value in terms of reliability, security and operative capacity over time. They can hence develop a clearly defined and robust blockchain governance, minimizing hazards and compensating possible market failures caused by volatility and proliferation of hit-and-run services, in so countering the possible gamification of essential services. TSP are also obliged to protect confidentiality of data. Such a high level of reliability can affect positively the general perception of users, institutions and investors about blockchain-based services, leading to a safer and faster adoption


### TrustedChain速

Ifin Sistemi developed TrustedChain速, the first permissioned blockchain network of European Trust Service Providers, aiming to provide decentralized blockchain-based services both to public administration and the private sector. 

Through the highest technical standards required by law for its nodes and backed by public institutions, TrustedChain速 is able to guarantee long-term preservation of data, as well as adequate security, scalability, reliability, continuity of service and law compliance within its eco-system. In this way, the network can overcome the typical risks inherent to many blockchains, such as the lack of adequate security and scalability, the general volatility of the infrastructure, and the subjugation of data and transactions to speculative market dynamics. Being highly reliable and safe, the applications built on the top of TrustedChain速 can be especially deployed in highly sensitive sectors, such as: e-government and public administration; digital payments and banking; healthcare; and industrial processes.
