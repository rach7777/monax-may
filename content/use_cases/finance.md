Enterprise interest in [ecosystem application](/explainers/ecosystem_applications) technology started in finance where many banks had originally been "keeping an eye on bitcoin" but later realized that when effectively positioned and built, that ecosystem applications could solve many of the real world problems that their banks and companies were facing in terms of costs of data reconciliation.

Monax was the first to market with a [permissionable blockchain](/explainers/permissioned_blockchains) which kick started enterprise interest in *using* ecosystem application technology and has remained the market leading platform on which complex financial ecosystem applications are being built. In addition to the high use of our `eris` [ecosystem application platform](/platform), Monax also licenses our industry-specific [finance software development kit](/library/#finance-sdk) which greatly reduces time to market for finance specific ecosystem applications while also increasing compliance gains along the way.

## Investment Banks

Many of the clearest use cases for leveraging ecosystem application technology in the finance vertical exist within investment banks. In our experience, commercial and investment banks are very likely to be the first vertical in production with complex ecosystem applications and will likely remain leaders in the use of the technology for quite a few years. Part of this is due to their head start in leading the adoption curve for the industrial use of this technology. Part of this is due to the business environment in which commercial and investment banks operate which is increasingly inter-connected and also more highly regulated than ever. The final part of this is that ecosystem application technology provides the base for commercial and investment banks to automate processes which they have been, to date, unable to automate for a variety of reasons.

There are two use case paradigms which run throughout most of the commercial and investment bank exploration to date: asset origination and asset servicing. The assets which are sought to be originated or serviced via the ecosystem application range from the very simple negotiable instrument and equity asset classes to the more complex syndicated loans and corporate bonds asset classes to the very complex derivatives asset classes. Different commercial and investment banks have publicly released information disclosing some of the asset classes which they are seeking to automate at a value chain level, but almost always the value is derived from focusing on either the origination area for the asset class or the more complex lifecycle servicing area for the asset class.

The business needs underlying these two use cases differ. Asset origination area provides a mechanism by which assets can be properly "manufactured" after this origination process has taken place with the agreed rules, then assets can leverage a [tag and track](/use_cases/logistics#supply-chains) application to track the assets as they "flow through the value" chain of finance either into more complex securities or other mechanisms by which commercial and investment banks bundle rights and obligations. The benefit to using ecosystem application technology to originate assets is the ability to more holistically and truthfully assert the relationships between asset classes which rely upon bundling of "lower level" asset classes.

This means that if a set of mortgages have been originated using ecosystem application technology, or the **tag** part of the tag and track use case, that the individual mortgages can more easily be tracked as they are sold between primary debt servicing companies and also tracked as those primary debt servicing companies bundle up the rights and obligations into mortgage backed securities. Due to the **tracking** part of the tag and track use case, holders of the mortgage backed securities can "see through" their assets into the underlying assets within the ecosystem application more easily.

Such an application, which is wholly possible to have prototyped for board buy-in by leveraging [Monax's premium support and education packages](/packages) and [Monax's finance software development kit](/library/#finance-sdk), increases transparency and reduces reconciliation costs across the mortgage "value chain" by leveraging a [blockchain](/explainers/blockchains)'s data assurances across ecosystem participants capabilities alongside [smart contracts](/explainers/smart_contracts)'s process assurances across ecosystem participants capabilities.

The asset servicing use case provides a mechanism which asserts that a given asset is in a given state. That state may be "default", or it may be "expired", or it may be "processing". The lifecycle of many assets can easily be tracked via ecosystem application technology. The asset servicing use case carries forward the story which explored by asset origination. Whereas asset origination was mostly concerned with "tag and track" of specific assets, the asset servicing use case is concerned with what the state of the asset is and what is needed to change its state (which is a bundle of rights and obligations as any [legal engineer](/explainers/legal_engineering) can tell you).

This means that if a set of syndicated loans are serviced via ecosystem application technology, that the primary servicing company would have an ability to assert to the entire ecosystem a whole range of events that could take place during the lifecycle of the asset from the simple such as the loan payments were made on time, or to the complex such as the company went into bankruptcy and the loans were discharged by the bankruptcy judge. The ecosystem of companies and individuals who had rights to access this information in real time can more easily participate in an ecosystem application than working with traditional application technology and continuing to email each other spreadsheets.

Such an application, which is wholly possible to have prototyped for board buy-in by leveraging [Monax's finance software development kit](/library/#finance-sdk) and [Monax's premium support and education packages](/packages), increases transparency and reduces reconciliation costs across the syndicated loans "value chain" by (again) leveraging a blockchain's data assurances across ecosystem participants capabilities alongside smart contract's process assurances across ecosystem participant's capabilities.

Monax's finance SDK has been battle tested from lessons learned working with some of the best investment banks in the world to understand their needs and these use cases with precision. Our legal engineers have worked to build the SDK as a set of modular components which leverage how rights and responsibilities are "stacked" in the real world to meet the needs of a whole range of use cases. We'd love to work with your company to see how our smart contracts and platform can help you meet your business objectives.

## Retail Banks

Retail banks have a lot of challenges. One of the biggest challenges many retail banks have is around records management for products which are typically dealt with using paper forms. The assets which these records relate to are often either moved off of the bank's balance sheet (say, for example, consumer credit card debt which is non-performing) or used within increasingly complex securitization schemes. Many times there are challenges in having a full and complete dossier of records for a given asset by all of the participants within the value chain that should rightfully have access to the records (such, as say, debt collection agencies, or holders of asset backed securities).

Moving such a use case from relying on traditional, siloed, architecture to utilizing ecosystem application technology is a relatively straight forward proposition. The requirements to manage this are fully available, today, by leveraging the `eris` [ecosystem application platform](/platform), along with Monax's Dual Integration add-on module (available for all of our SDKs). This add-on module tracks documents in a variety of content addressable storage mechanisms and also links those rights and responsibilities to other contract suites such as our contracts which handle asset management. By combining, our asset management contracts with our dual integration add-on module, retail banks can solve their record retention problem more simply than any other technology which is available on the market.

The advantages of utilizing ecosystem application technology for such record management instead of traditional application architecture are the certainty and auditability that utilizing ecosystem application technology. This use case in particular uses [smart contracts](/explainers/smart_contracts) to track a bundle of documents along with distributed data lake and encryption technology to distribute the records.

Monax has long been a world leader in this paradigm of tracking records using both smart contracts and data lake technologies. In January, 2015, when many of our fast followers were first learning about blockchains, we provided a demonstrator application for our platform which was a "distributed YouTube". That application, and many we have built in combination with our partners and customers since have leveraged this paradigm which now is well-trodden terrain.

We'd love to work with your company to see how our smart contracts and platform can help you meet your business objectives. Just **<a href="/?monax_viewer_type=end_user&product_interest=sdk#contact-monax">get in touch!</a>**
