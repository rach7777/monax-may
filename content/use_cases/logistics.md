There are very clear foundational use cases for leveraging [ecosystem application](/explainers/ecosystem_applications) technology to track goods as they flow through a supply chain.

One of the key aspects of blockchains (one of the corner stone tools for building ecosystem applications) is their ability to **tag** a particular physical item by that item's unique identifier. Using smart contracts (another of the corner stone tools for building ecosystem applications) application builders can then add sophisticated **track**ing mechanisms for the physical item.

These **tag and track** use cases are a primary foundational use case for building ecosystem applications, and it is why we have built our [logistics software development kit](/library/#logistics-sdk) to assist application builders.

## Supply Chain

From corporate social responsibility to high value goods to critical manufacturing components, a number of areas can successfully leverage **tag and track** use cases to ensure the authenticity of physical goods across a range of value chain participants. Supply chain ecosystem smart contracts give a previously unattainable window on on the integrated physical, financial and regulatory supply chain, enabling simplification and efficiency in global trade processes that were historically complex and opaque. 

While traditional applications can provide an authenticity mechanism for many physical goods, those applications always run under the control of a single entity within the value chain. This entity can never strongly assert that the information it provides (perhaps via an open API, perhaps via a closed API, perhaps via PDF exports, perhaps not at all) is accurate, but where incentives are not properly aligned the participants relying on the single entity to assert the authenticity of certain goods may decide that there was a better way.

Instead of relying on a single entity to assert the authenticity of a physical good which flows through a value chain, participants within that value chain can more simply and effectively leverage ecosystem application technology to assert **collectively** via a blockchain's consensus mechanisms, tracking smart contracts, and other tools, that a given good is authentic in some particular manner. This authenticity function may be leveraged to greatly reduce fraud and counterfeiting, and for sharing regulatory compliance burdens at an ecosystem level. 

Areas which can greatly benefit from **tag and track** use cases:

* pharmaceuticals where fraud can cause extreme health risks;
* high value physical parts for critical infrastructure;
* luxury goods where counterfeiting and procure-to-pay fraud is common;
* goods which are semi-fungible and pooled which also need to be tracked through a value chain; and
* high value goods for critical sectors of the economy.

Any company which participates in a value chain that contains sufficiently complex goods which need to be tracked to an item across a range of intermediaries within the value chain can opt to build its own ecosystem application using Monax's products.

To build your supply chain **tag and track** system you can always leverage `eris`, the free and open source [ecosystem application platform](/platform) built by Monax, and build your application from scratch. If you are new to building ecosystem applications, our [premium support and education packages](/packages) will help you get started quicker and provide a vital forum for your engineering team to get assistance from our experts. Finally, we offer a [logistics software development kit and add-on modules](/library/#logistics-sdk) which will provide the base smart contracts for your team to quickly and simply build your application.

## Airlines

Airlines are a fascinating vertical with many, many moving pieces (sorry for the pun). Airline companies exist within a range of value chains which require high levels (and costs) of coordination with many other entities from regulatory agencies across every jurisdiction in which the company operates (typically hundreds) to airports and baggage handling companies to ticketing companies and a range of other value chains, airlines may be some of the most connected companies in the globalized information age economy. One glitch in the supply chain cause a "daisy chain" effect of delays. As such, it seems evident that airlines can gain significantly from participating in ecosystem applications.

One of the questions which our company often receives is how this technology can be effectively leveraged by a diverse range of companies. "Is it necessary for all companies to change over to using ecosystem applications at the same time?" Our answer is a resounding no. There are numerous ways in which ecosystem applications can be brought to market iteratively. Ecosystem applications are meant to replace other coordination mechanisms (such as the ever-popular emailed PDF) rather than replacing systems which are purely meant to track information and processes internal to a company. Ecosystem applications can easily be architected in such a manner that they provide a more auditable, effective, and efficient coordination platform for information and processes which **are not** purely internal but rather are a mixture of internal and external processes or are purely external processes. This is the sweet spot which ecosystem applications fill.

Airlines face a number of these. One particularly interesting use case of ecosystem application technology "in the air" deals less with commercial planes than with drones, which need to be tracked in a more resilient manner than they currently are. Drones, as they become more prevalent, are becoming an increasing hazard to airlines and to other drones. Tracking drone flight paths and operators in an open registry is one mechanism by which both drone operators and other stakeholders can more effectively coordinate to ensure the safety of everyone.

Another interesting use case for ecosystem application technology is to leverage a **tag and track** application for ensuring the authenticity of spare parts for planes (which are, generally, critical systems that we do not want to have inauthentic parts). With end-to-end supply chain functionality, airlines can ensure that the right part will be at the right place at the right time, promoting safety and preventing flight delays.

Yet another interesting use case for leveraging ecosystem application technology is in tracking cargo and payments within airline alliances -- typically a paper heavy, error prone, and costly process.

If you are an airline or airport seeking to extend your knowledge of and use of ecosystem application technology, do <a href="/?monax_viewer_type=end_user&product_interest=premium_support#contact-monax"> get in touch</a> as we would love to work with your company to become one of the knowledge leaders within your industry about this transformative technology.

## Shipping

Shipping companies, like airlines, operate in an environment rife with coordination costs. Shipping companies have a large range of value chains in which they participate. Often they are a vital conduit for an overall value chain in that they are the common transportation link between a producer and a wholesaler/importer/retailer. Not only do shipping companies provide a vital link in many value chains, but the companies themselves also have a number of value chains in which they participate in more directly.

Similar to airlines, shipping companies have a high need for authenticity as to the manufacturer of critical parts for their ships. It is extremely costly and/or dangerous for counterfeit parts of lower quality than expected to be added to a ship instead of authentic parts. As such, shipping companies have a large need to ensure that critical parts have been authentically produced by the approved manufacturer and delivered properly.

Shipping companies could improve in-port processes by working with their customers and customs agents in highly trafficked ports to streamline the provision of the necessary documents and information about containers being imported into a particular country. Many early explorations of ecosystem applications have focused on the very large and complex trade finance market. Should the use of ecosystem applications become the standard mechanism for dealing with trade finance issues, shipping companies will be an integral component to that value chain as they will be required to work with importing customs agents and numerous other actors within the value chain to ensure that goods are delivered and paid as noted by the terms of the finance deal which enables the import process.

If your company is in the shipping industry and would like to understand how to more effectively leverage ecosystem application technology, we'd love to help.
