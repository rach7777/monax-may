The use cases that are relevant to you likely depend on who you are. The uses of [ecosystem applications](/explainers/ecosystem_applications) are broad and deep. Many of the most interesting applications are longer term and rely on more "foundational" use cases to be implemented by a range of ecosystem participants. Other use cases may **not** be good uses of ecosystem application technology and rather can be more effectively built using traditional application architecture.

# Monax's Use Cases Decision Framework

The table below summarizes our internal decision framework for thinking about what systems make good candidates for leveraging ecosystem application technology instead of traditional single-company centry application. The more that one is able to answer **yes** to the questions, the better the use case.

| Number | Question | Answer |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| 1 | Is the use case not currently digitized? | Yes / No |
| 2 | Is the use case not digitized because of high coordination costs? | Yes / No |
| 3 | Does the use case require cryptographic certainty that events have happened? | Yes / No |
| 4 | Does the use case require marks of authenticity to be digitally "passported" between participants? | Yes / No |
| 5 | Does the use case currently require multiple humans too perform data entry within multiple, redundant participants? | Yes / No |
| 6 | Is data transparency amongst participants more valuable than keeping siloed information private? | Yes / No |
| 7 | Does the use case require high transparency with respect to the processes being performed? | Yes / No |
| 8 | Will participants within a system benefit in a syncronous manner by standardizing processes? | Yes / No |
| 9 | Is process transparency amongst participants more valuable than keeping processes secret? | Yes / No |
| 10 | Can participants reduce compliance costs by leveraging transparency by directly sharing data and processes with regulatory agencies? | Yes / No |

Over the course of the entries in this section of our site we will bring out many of the criteria which we leverage to analyze whether a particular use case is well suited to ecosystem application technology and explain why the questions are relevant to understanding a good use case to leverage building applications that run on a network or ecosystem level instead of how we have traditionally built applications.
