When using default platform architecture, whether marketplaces, exchanges, government services, or on-demand commercial services, we wholly rely on a service provider to manage the business processes required for the system.

### **BUT**

With Eris, communities, businesses, governments, and anybody else can use smart contracts to automate their business processes between organizations. All on their own.

### From anywhere. With anyone. For any purpose.
