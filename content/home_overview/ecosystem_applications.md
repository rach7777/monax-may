When using default platform architecture, whether marketplaces, exchanges, government services, or on-demand commercial services, we wholly rely on a service provider to manage the relationships required by the participants within the system.

### **BUT**

With ecosystem applications, communities, businesses, governments, and anybody else can automate their data driven relationships with other organizations. All on their own.

### From anywhere. With anyone. For any purpose.
