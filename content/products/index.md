At Monax, our main "product" is our Free and Open Source toolkit called: [Eris](/platform).

That said, we are a for-profit company and below are the value-add products we offer on top of our FOSS tooling. They greatly simplify the use of smart contract technology in an enterprise context.

# Smart Contract Modules

The core of our offering are the *Monax Smart Contract Modules*. These are modular, interoperable components that can be used to assemble enterprise-grade smart contract applications. 

Building Smart Contract applications using the *Monax Smart Contract Modules* offers a variety of advantages:
* Speed: Faster time-to-market as only last-mile configuration is required
* Upgrades: Updated versions of modules can quickly add features and fix bugs
* Quality: Highly tested contracts written according to best practices in smart contract development
* Compliance: Vetted by Eris legal engineers

Our smart contract modules are written in a modular fashion, which allows combining them to create complex smart contract applications. As modules get updated, a rapidly increasing range of applications and use cases become available.

# Monax Value-Add Services
## Developer Training
The hardest part is always getting started. That’s why we have been working closely with Validity Labs to develop an in-person, immersive workshop focused on getting developers up-to-speed with understanding how to build smart contract applications using the Eris platform. The content of the 2-day training covers:

* Introduction to blockchain and smart contracts
* Ecosystem applications
* Setting up and navigating the Eris stack
* Introduction to smart contract writing with Solidity
* Best practices of smart contract programming

Participants will gain hands-on experience through developing an MVP for a mortgage backed security (MBS) application. The first training is scheduled to take place in November. Please sign up for the Monax email list to get notified when registration opens. Contact us if you are interested in the Monax Developer Training for your company.

## Smart Contract Specification & Drafting
The Monax team has deep expertise in developing compliant smart contract applications for some of the world’s best companies, ranging from bulge bracket banks to insurance conglomerates. The unique combination of technology expertise with understanding of legal processes at Monax is unparalleled in the industry and invaluable for companies with significant compliance requirements.

For select clients, we do full smart contract specification and drafting work, either in combination with your existing systems integration partner or one of Monax’ existing partner relationships. These services can range from assessing the use case and the business requirements, to designing the application architecture, to writing smart contract code. Systems integration or user interface work are not offered. 

Applications could range from developing proofs-of-concept to explore how smart contracts could be integrated into the existing enterprise architecture, to developing pilot or even production-level systems that will handle real-world data.
Capacity for this is extremely limited and only available for pre-selected clients.

## Technical Support
Monax offers Tier-2 operational and development support to accompany the build-out process and ensure of production-level applications. Support can range from helping troubleshoot solidity contracts during development, to solving network or consensus issues with applications or PoCs in production.
