# Smart Contract Modules

The core of our offering are the *Monax Smart Contract Modules*. These are modular, interoperable components that can be used to assemble enterprise-grade smart contract applications.

Building Smart Contract applications using the *Monax Smart Contract Modules* offers a variety of advantages:
* __Speed__: Faster time-to-market as only last-mile configuration is required
* __Upgrades__: Updated versions of modules can quickly add features and fix bugs
* __Quality__: Highly tested contracts written according to best practices in smart contract development
* __Compliance__: Vetted by Monax legal engineers

Our smart contract modules are written in a modular fashion, which allows combining them to create complex smart contract applications. As modules get updated, a rapidly increasing range of applications and use cases become available.

# Monax Value-Add Services
## Developer Training
The hardest part is always getting started. That’s why we have been working closely with [Validity Labs](https://validitylabs.org/) to develop an in-person, immersive workshop focused on getting developers up-to-speed with building smart contract applications using the Eris platform. The content of the 2-day training covers:

* Introduction to blockchain and smart contracts
* Ecosystem applications
* Setting up and navigating the Eris stack
* Introduction to smart contract writing with Solidity
* Best practices of smart contract programming

Participants will gain hands-on experience through developing an MVP for a mortgage backed security (MBS) application. The first training is scheduled to take place in November. Sign up for the Monax email list to get notified when registration opens. Enterprise versions of the training are available.

## Smart Contract Specification & Drafting
The Monax team has deep expertise in developing compliant smart contract applications for the world’s best companies, from bulge bracket banks to insurance conglomerates. The unique combination of technology expertise with understanding of legal processes at Monax is unparalleled in the industry and invaluable for companies with significant compliance requirements.

We do full smart contract specification and drafting work, either in combination with your existing systems integration partner or one of Monax’ existing partner relationships. These services can range from assessing the use case and the business requirements, to designing the application architecture, to writing smart contract code. Capacity for this is limited and only available for pre-selected clients.

## Technical Support
Monax offers Tier-2 operational and development support to accompany the build-out process and support production-level applications. Support can range from troubleshooting solidity contracts during development, to solving network or consensus issues with PoCs or production-level applications.

# Monax Partners Program
For companies to leverage the opportunities offered by blockchain, an enterprise-grade technology platform like Eris is only part of the solution. Identifying the perfect industry use case, defining the correct requirements, building user interface and system integrations or analyzing the bottom-line benefits of your Eris applications is where our partners come in. Monax has deep relationships and partnership agreements with a variety of leading technology and change management providers including PwC, EY and Deloitte as well as some of the biggest technology integrators.

Ask your technology provider if they already have Eris capabilities or approach us and we can connect you with one of our Monax Partners.
