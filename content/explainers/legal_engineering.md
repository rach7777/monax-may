# Monax Legal Engineering

At its simplest, legal engineering is writing [smart contracts](/explainers/smart_contracts/) that execute legal rights and responsibilities. Previously, such rights and responsibilities were enshrined in prose documents and performed by people. However, many contractual rights and responsibilities, especially in today's increasingly data-driven world, can be represented in code and processed by computers, which improves adherence and enhances performance. 

## Blockchains are legaltech

The advent of distributed ledger technology, including blockchains, has enabled writing smart contracts that can execute the terms of a contract, make decisions, store information, and interact with other smart contracts. For a more in-depth explanation of  smart contracts, please see our [explainer](/explainers/smart_contracts/).

At Monax, legal engineering means writing smart contracts that leverage the capabilities of the technology to automate complex legal transactions and realize synergies from improved adherence, enhanced performance, greater efficiency, and lower transaction costs. Use case applications of smart contracts include evidence, money, property, ownership, affidavit, audit, trade, tracking and registry, underscoring the point that smart contracts are legal tech. Smart contracts can enable breakthrough use cases like true delivery-versus-payment in securities settlement and sorely needed trade finance models like reliable invoice tracking and letters of credit. To build these and other complex use cases takes legal engineering. 

## Law and code, evolving together

Smart contract solutions with pre-existing legal contexts, like financial, insurance and commercial models, must work in harmony with existing law. Law provides many tools for creating instruments to achieve commercial intention, for example, contracts and the means to enforce them. 

Today the law is evolving at global scale, in code. Interoperable systems, rather than dark data pools, are the commercial information models of the future. Legal systems do not evolve at the same pace as technology; to ensure that your encoded agreements will be recognized by courts today, we recommend Dual Integration. For more on Dual Integration, see our brief explainer.	

## Enabling humans to make decisions and commitments today

With careful prospective legal engineering, entities can create smart contract relationships in code that self-execute contractual intent while functioning within broader commercial realities. 
Legal engineering smart contracts means configuring reliable future events in code, enabling humans to make decisions and commitments today. In order to serve industrial needs, smart contracts must be built by a team with deep understanding of coding systems and legal systems, as well as the vision to put it together. Monax legal engineers are experienced lawyers and developers with the technical know-how to bring smart contract use cases to life.
