Monax Smart Contracts allow the assembly and configuration of ecosystem application infrastructure and business processes.
```

Our core product offering are the *Monax Smart Contract Bundles*. These are modular, interoperable packages of smart contracts that can be used to build the components of enterprise-grade applications that leverage blockchain / distributed ledger technology. Beyond setting up basic solution infrastructure, business logic and other customizations can be plugged in and configured to create solutions that appeal to many commercial as well as public, open ecosystems.


Building applications using the *Monax Smart Contract Bundles* offers a variety of advantages:

* __Speed__: Faster time-to-market as only last-mile configuration is required to set up an application 
* __Upgrades__: Updated versions of bundles can quickly add features and fix bugs
* __Quality__: Highly tested contracts written according to best practices in smart contract development
* __Compliance__: Vetted by Monax legal engineers


Our smart contract bundles are written in a modular fashion, which allows combining them to create complex smart contract applications. With a growing variety of bundles a rapidly increasing range of applications and use cases become available.
