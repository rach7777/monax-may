Our core product offering are the *Monax Smart Contract Modules*. These are modular, interoperable components that can be used to assemble enterprise-grade smart contract applications.

Building Smart Contract applications using the *Monax Smart Contract Modules* offers a variety of advantages:

* __Speed__: Faster time-to-market as only last-mile configuration is required
* __Upgrades__: Updated versions of modules can quickly add features and fix bugs
* __Quality__: Highly tested contracts written according to best practices in smart contract development
* __Compliance__: Vetted by Monax legal engineers

Our smart contract modules are written in a modular fashion, which allows combining them to create complex smart contract applications. As modules get updated, a rapidly increasing range of applications and use cases become available.
