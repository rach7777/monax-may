Monax's Software Development Kits enable the assembly and configuration of ecosystem application infrastructure and business processes.
```

At Monax, our Software Development Kits are our core product offering.

*Monax Smart Contract SDKs* are designed and built by our cutting edge [legal engineers](/explainers/legal_engineering) and allow our customers to turn their ideas into reality much faster by shortening the learning curve, leveraging and building on top of battle-tested components, and concentrating on valuable business logic instead of application plumbing. The result is a reduced time-to-market or simply less overhead conducting POCs and other experiments.

Of course, with the Eris platform you always have the choice to develop your application from scratch by designing and coding [smart contracts](/explainers/smart_contracts) using Solidity and using the emergent industry standard Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contract interpreter on our [permissioned blockchain](/explainers/permissioned_blockchains).

# Introduction

Our SDKs are modular, interoperable packages of smart contracts that can be used to build enterprise-grade applications and services running on a blockchain (also known as distributed ledger technology). Beyond facilitating an easier setup of application infrastructure, our SDKs also provide APIs and extensible interfaces to add use case-specific business logic and other customizations.

Monax SDKs allow our customers to turn their designs for commercial as well as public ecosystem applications into reality much faster by shortening the learning curve, leveraging and building on top of battle-tested components, and concentrating on valuable business logic instead of application plumbing.

# Benefits

Building applications using Monax's SDKs offers a variety of advantages:

* **Speed**: Faster time-to-market as only last-mile configuration is required to set up many applications
* **Upgrades**: Updated versions of our add-on modules and SDKs can quickly add features and fix bugs
* **Quality**: Highly tested contracts written according to best practices in smart contract development
* **Compliance**: Vetted by Monax legal engineers

Our smart contracts are written in a modular fashion which allows combining them to create complex smart contract applications. With a growing variety of modules a rapidly increasing range of applications and use cases become available.

# What SDKs and Add-On Modules are Available?

We offer an ever expanding range of both industry specific SDKs as well as add-on modules. Each SDK has approved add-on modules that provide additional, in-depth, use-case specific functionality out of the box on top of our software development kits.

## Base SDK

Monaxâ€™s Base Software Development Kit gets you up and running faster than ever. The Base SDK contains all the smart contracts that help to set up permissions, authorizations, organization structure and manage the lifecycle of any ecosystem application developed on the Eris platform. We offer a number of add-on modules that are available for the Base SDK detailed below.

## Finance SDK

Monax's Finance Software Development Kit empowers your financial application with the base requirements needed to build sophisticated ecosystem applications that will provide a fast and dramatic ROI for your blockchain exploration efforts. The Finance SDK contains all the smart contracts included in the Base SDK as well as financial account management and simple asset lifecycle contracts which help with clearing, netting, and other necessities. We offer a number of add-on modules that are available and are planned for the Finance SDK detailed below.

## Insurance SDK

Monax's Insurance Software Development Kit empowers your risk application with the base requirements needed to build sophisticated ecosystem applications that will ensure compliance with meaningful regulations in the jurisdictions where your firm operates. The Insurance SDK contains all the smart contracts included in the Base SDK as well as insurance account management and simple risk instrument lifecycle contracts which help with sufficiently understanding risk profiles. We offer a number of add-on modules that are available and are planned for the Insurance SDK detailed below.

## Logistics SDK

Monax's Logistics Software Development Kit accelerates your supply chain application with all the base requirements needed to build a sophisticated application that tracks assets at the value chain level. The Logistics SDK contains all the smart contracts included in the Base SDK as well as logistics account and vendor management along with simple asset tracking contracts. We offer a number of add-on modules that are available and are planned for the Logistics SDK detailed below.

# Extensability

Our SDKs can be extended in a variety of manners to fit your specific use case. Many of our customers have successfully taken our SDKs as the base of a range of use cases which we never would have contemplated. The SDKs can be extended either by adding additional Ethereum Virtual Machine contracts which interface with the SDKs or add-on modules your company has subscribed to, or they could be extended using native contracts.

In addition to extending functionality via additional contracts, customers have successfully extended the SDKs into existing caching systems for advanced system queries.

# Interfaces

Our SDKs provide two types of interfaces at this time. The first interface can be accessed by other smart contracts which reside on the permissioned blockchain on which the SDK has been deployed. By adding additional functionality at the smart contract layer, customers can easily add required functionality to their ecosystem application.

Our SDKs can also be interfaced via API servers that in turn talk to the permissioned blockchain. In 2017 subscribers to our SDKs and add-on modules will gain access to a javascript native API which will provide a RESTful interface to the SDKs out of the box *or* a Java-based Apache Camel interface that can work with your existing ERP, CRM, IMS, and other systems.

# Licensing

We offer two licensing tiers for our software development kits and add-on modules. Both licensing tiers entitle customers to consistent upgrades to the smart contracts comprising the SDK or add-on module this qualifies your company for continuous access to code that is refactored, updated to match platform changes, has bug fixes applied, and an established roadmap of functionality that enables new contracts and updates required by regulation and technology changes. As smart contract technology is an emergent and rapidly-evolving field, Monax SDK subscribers benefit from instant updates, code improvements and bug fixes to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with state-of-the-art blockchain tech.

The first licensing tier is a **Development License for our SDKs and Add-On Modules**. The development license is a flat-fee per month with subscription length and volume discounts. One license is needed per application leveraging our SDK or add-on modules. Developer licensed SDK's and add-on modules may not be used in production applications.

The second licensing tier is a **Production License for our SDKs and Add-On Modules**. The production license is a usage fee model payable per quarter with volume discounts. One license is needed per application leveraging our SDK or add-on modules.

# How to Purchase

We will offer our SDKs to the general developer community in 2017 but at this time they are fully available via the Monax partnership network. If you would like to leverage Monax's cutting edge, legally compliant, software development kits to empower your ecosystem application please let your technology provider know, or get in touch with us via our contact form and our account managers will be in touch regarding pricing details.
