<i>Monax Smart Contracts</i> enable the assembly and configuration of ecosystem application infrastructure and business processes.
</p>

Our core product offering are the *Monax Smart Contract Bundles*. These are modular, interoperable packages of smart contracts that can be used to build enterprise-grade components and services running on blockchain / distributed ledger technology. Beyond facilitating an easier setup of smart contract solution infrastructure, our bundles also provide APIs and extensible interfaces to add use case-specific business logic and other customizations.

*Monax Smart Contract Bundles* allow our customers to turn their designs for commercial as well as public ecosystem applications into reality much faster by shortening the learning curve, leveraging and building on top of battle-tested components, and concentrating on valuable business logic instead of application plumbing.

<br/>
Building applications using the *Monax Smart Contract Bundles* offers a variety of advantages:

* __Speed__: Faster time-to-market as only last-mile configuration is required to set up an application 
* __Upgrades__: Updated versions of bundles can quickly add features and fix bugs
* __Quality__: Highly tested contracts written according to best practices in smart contract development
* __Compliance__: Vetted by Monax legal engineers

<br/>
Our smart contract bundles are written in a modular fashion which allows combining them to create complex smart contract applications. With a growing variety of bundles a rapidly increasing range of applications and use cases become available.
