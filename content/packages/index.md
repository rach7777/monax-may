# Value-Add Services

## Developer Training

The hardest part is always getting started. That’s why we have been working closely with [Validity Labs](https://validitylabs.org/) to develop an in-person, immersive workshop focused on getting developers up-to-speed with building smart contract applications using the `eris` platform. The content of the 2-day training covers:

* Introduction to blockchain and smart contracts
* Ecosystem applications
* Setting up and navigating the `eris` platform
* Introduction to smart contract writing with Solidity
* Best practices of smart contract programming

Participants will gain hands-on experience through developing an MVP for a mortgage backed security (MBS) application. The first training is scheduled to take place in November. <a href="#" class="newsletter-signup">Sign up for the Monax email list</a> to get notified when registration opens. On-premise enterprise versions of the training are available.

## Smart Contract Specification & Drafting

The Monax team has deep expertise in developing compliant smart contract applications for the world’s best companies, from bulge bracket banks to insurance conglomerates. The unique combination of technology expertise with understanding of legal processes at Monax is unparalleled in the industry and invaluable for companies with significant compliance requirements.

We do full smart contract specification and drafting work, either in combination with your existing systems integration partner or one of Monax’ existing partner relationships. These services can range from assessing the use case and the business requirements, to designing the application architecture, to writing smart contract code.

Capacity for this service is limited and only available for pre-selected clients with highly interesting use cases.

## Technical Support

Monax offers Tier-2 operational and development support to accompany the build-out process and support production-level applications. Support can range from troubleshooting solidity contracts during development, to solving network or consensus issues with PoCs or production-level applications.

Ask your technology provider today if they have a capability to provide front-line support as you iterate your applications towards production or approach us and we can connect you with one of our Monax Partners.
