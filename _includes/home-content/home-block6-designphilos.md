### Design Philosophy

Think of us as the node.js of p2p.

Most blockchain systems in use today are built to transfer tokens representing monetary value among a network of mutually, and equally, untrustworthy actors. They are built to be standalone monoliths, and their security and consensus models are stagnant. Modern internet services require more flexibility. 

Eris' Blockchain Application Software Stack is easy to set up, easy to parameterise, and fully functional for immediate use by developers. Best of all, it's completely free to use.
