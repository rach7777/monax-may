### Design Philosophy

Most blockchain systems in use today are built to transfer tokens representing monetary value among a network of mutually, and equally, untrustworthy actors. As such, they are built to be standalone monoliths, with the result that their security and consensus models are stagnant and resistant to change.

But modern internet services require flexibility and adaptability on the part of platform operators and service providers, who are incentivised to conduct themselves properly out of good commercial practice. Developers wishing to utilise blockchain technology deserve an application stack which allows them to benefit from purpose-built distributed blockchain architecture as well as more public, heavier and more stable blockchains and peer-to-peer protocols.

At Eris Industries, we feel it is tedious, clumsy, and ultimately unnecessary for every aspiring distributed application developer to build entirely atop a public, fully trustless chain like Bitcoin. We give developers the tools to not only set their own levels of trustlessness and security on their blockchains but to also build applications on top of other, more established blockchains and peer-to-peer protocols.

Think of us as the node.js of p2p.
