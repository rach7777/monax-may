### Design Philosophy

Most blockchain systems in use today are built with the sole purpose of securely transfering tokens representing monetary value among a network of mutually, and equally, untrustworthy actors. They require a mentality of data permanence. They are built to be standalone monoliths, and their security and consensus models are largely static.

We feel that modern internet services require more flexibility and modularity. We do not think that all actors in a system are untrustworthy. We do not see all data as requiring permanence in order to be useful. We feel the world is complex and that change is inevitable. We build software which embraces this philosophy.

Our software is easy to set up, easy to parameterise, and fully functional for immediate use by developers. Best of all, it's completely free to use.
