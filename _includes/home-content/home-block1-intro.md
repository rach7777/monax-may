### Eris Industries Was Formed to Answer Two Questions

1) Is it possible to build applications which have the benefits of interconnectedness, but without servers? **It is**. Distributed applications can perform the same functions of modern web applications by enlisting users to participate in the management and security of these applications' data.

2) Is it possible to create data-driven interactions which are both autonomous and legally compliant? **It is**. Data-driven interactions are not exempt from legal norms and procedures, and platforms capable of operating within existing legal frameworks will be profoundly useful to businesses and individuals alike.

With Eris Industries' open-source **Distributed Application Software Stack**, developers can rapidly design, test, and deploy distributed applications which are as flexible, user-friendly, and legally compliant as they are secure.

Think of us as the node.js of peer-to-peer technology.
