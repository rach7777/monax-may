### Today's Challenges are Data-Driven

Tackling data-driven challenges has been greatly eased by improvements in computing power, but at great cost in terms of infrastructure expenditure - labour, real estate, and hardware alike. 

The advent of blockchain and other peer-to-peer technologies, however, demonstrates that mathematics and distributed networks are capable of performing the same functions at substantially reduced cost. These new technologies enable increased participation of users and developers in the security and management of data-driven interactions, allowing users to claim back control over their data, increasing security and privacy, and lowering barriers to entry, while still maintaining the benefits of interconnectedness the Internet provides.

Eris Industries designs and builds distributed computing systems which leverage these technologies. On the open-source Eris Stack, you can too.
