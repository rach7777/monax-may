### Today's Challenges are Data-Driven

Confronting data-driven challenges has been greatly eased by improvements in computing power, but at great cost in terms of infrastructure expenditure - labour, real estate, and hardware alike. At the same time, the movement of users away from isolated computers using standalone pieces of software towards web applications has raised significant concerns about user privacy as well as the security and resilience of the data silos upon which modern life increasingly relies. 

Eris Industries thus started with a question: is it possible to make web applications which have all the benefits of interconnectedness which we gain with modern web applications, but without servers? Could such a thing even be done? 

The answer is that it can. Distributed, peer-to-peer networks now perform the same functions of legacy infrastructure, but without reliance on centralized silos and at substantially reduced cost. With Eris Industries' open-source **Blockchain Application Software Stack**, developers can for the first time rapidly design, test and deploy novel distributed applications over the public internet which are as flexible and user-friendly as they are secure.
