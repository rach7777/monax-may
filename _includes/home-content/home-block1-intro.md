### Eris Industries Was Formed to Answer Two Questions

First, is it possible to build applications which have the benefits of interconnectedness but without servers? **It is**. Distributed networks can perform the same functions of modern web applications by enlisting the applications' users to participate in the management and security of the applications' data.

Second, is it possible to autonomously manage data-driven interactions in a fully compliant manner? **It is**. Data-driven interactions do not require exemption from legal norms and processes which have developed over centuries; indeed, they can be autonomously managed in a fully compliant manner.

With Eris Industries' open-source **Blockchain Application Software Stack**, developers can rapidly design, test, and deploy distributed applications which are as flexible, user-friendly, and legally compliant as they are secure.

You can think of us as the node.js of peer-to-peer technology.

What will you build on the Eris Stack?
