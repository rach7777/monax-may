### Towards a Smarter World

Commercial problems are increasingly data-driven. Computing power allows individuals and businesses to define a problem, determine a solution, test the results, and rapidly iterate - over and over again. 

Existing solutions enable this only after substantial capital investment in real estate, labour and hardware. Blockchain technology, by contrast, achieves this through the use of mathematics and distributed computing - and without human oversight. 

Eris Industries uses blockchain technology to design and build self-operating and cryptographically secure internet applications.
