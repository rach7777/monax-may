### Toward a Smarter World

Good technology increases human potential by improving organizational processes which scale tasks, and providing the tools to manage them.

In a world which is increasingly data-driven, commercial problems are increasingly expressible in code, allowing us to define a problem, determine a solution, test the results, and rapidly iterate - over and over again. 

Existing data solutions accomplish this only after substantial investment in bricks-and-mortar, labour, and computing hardware to secure this data, and rely on advertising revenues to recoup the expense. Blockchain technology, by contrast, achieves certainty and security through the use of cryptography and distributed computing networks alone, while utilising a wide range of parameterisable incentive models.

A smarter world demands less data hoarding and more data utility. It operates itself to increase profitability. It evolves to self-manage complexity. And it needs to be better than what already exists.
