### Toward a Smarter World

In our data-driven world, commercial problems are increasingly expressible in code, allowing us to define a problem, determine a solution, test the results, and rapidly iterate - over and over again. 

Existing solutions accomplish this only after substantial capital investment in land, labour and hardware. Blockchain technology, by contrast, achieves this through the use of mathematics and distributed computing.

An architecture for a smarter world demands less data hoarding and more data utility. It needs to operate itself to improve profitability, evolve to self-manage complexity, and be superior to that which exists.

#### Eris Industries builds this architecture. With our platform, so can you.
