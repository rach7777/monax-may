### Towards a Smarter World

It empowers individuals and organisations to better perform tasks. It improves processes which efficiently scale tasks. It enables management of increasingly complex tasks. Recent advances have been enabled by vast increases in processing power, storage capacity, and connectivity speed.

Despite improved hardware, legacy design architecture ties developers and organizations to silos which are ineffective and inefficient in light of increasingly complex data driven interactions.

**A smarter world needs less data hoarding and more data utility.**

A smarter world does not come from unilateral hoarding of data during a data-driven interaction between customers and businesses. A smarter world requires a reevaluation of data ownership on the one hand and increased utility of the data collected on the other. A smarter world evolves from developing a participatory architecture paradigm for managing complexity of data driven interactions.
