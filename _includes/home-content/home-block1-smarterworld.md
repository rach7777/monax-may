### Toward a Smarter World

Good technology increases human potential. It empowers individuals to better perform tasks. It improves organizational processes which scale tasks. It enables management of increasingly complex tasks.

A smarter world needs less emphasis on data hoarding and more emphasis on data utility. A smarter world requires a reevaluation of how individuals effectively participate in business processes. A smarter world evolves from a participatory architecture which self-manages complex, data-driven interactions.

Eris Industries builds this architecture.
