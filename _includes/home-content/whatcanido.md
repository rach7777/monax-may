## What can I do with Eris?

When using default platform architecture, whether marketplaces, exchanges, government services, or on-demand commercial services, we rely on the service provider to manage the system and carry out our instructions.

### **BUT**

With Eris, communities, businesses, governments, and anybody else can use smart contracts to manage their data-driven relationships on their own.

### From anywhere, with anyone, for any purpose they see fit.
