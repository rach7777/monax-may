### Decerver

#### The Distributed Application Server

The Decerver is the application server for Eris Industries' Distributed Application Software Stack. Using the Decerver, developers can build distributed applications which easily interact with a diverse set of blockchain and peer-to-peer protocols, all of which have been harmonized in an interactive layer that can be accessed via JavaScript. The Decerver is easily extensible to work with additional network protocols simply by writing a module wrapper.

### Thelonious

#### The Makers' Blockchain Design

Thelonious is Eris Industries' customizable, smart-contract enabled, smart-contract controlled blockchain design and one component of our Distributed Application Software Stack. Derived from the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) protocol, but built to meet differing design goals, Thelonious gives developers the ultimate flexibility to define their own state-of-the-art blockchain. Thelonious is not meant to be one blockchain, but millions of them, each tailor-made for specific organizations or applications.
