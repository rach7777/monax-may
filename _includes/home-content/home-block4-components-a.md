### DeCerver

#### The Decentralized Application Server

The DeCerver is the application server for Eris Industries' Blockchain Application Software Stack. Applications built on top of an Eris' Blockchain Application Software Stack have access to a number of decentralized or peer-to-peer protocols, all of which have been harmonized in an interactive layer that can be accessed via JavaScript.

Using the DeCerver, developers can build blockchain-secured applications which easily interact with a diverse set of decentralised protocols. The DeCerver is easily extensible to work with additional network protocols simply by writing a module wrapper.

### Thelonious

#### The Makers' Blockchain Design

Thelonious is Eris Industries' customizable, contract-controlled blockchain design and one component of our Blockchain Application Software Stack. Derived from the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) protocol, but built to meet differing design goals, Thelonious gives developers the ultimate flexibility to define their own state-of-the-art blockchain.

Thelonious differs from other blockchains in that it is not merely smart contract-enabled, it is also smart contract-controlled. As such Thelonious is not meant to be one blockchain, but millions of them, each tailor-made for specific organizations or applications.
