### DeCerver

#### The Decentralized Application Server

The DeCerver is the server for Eris Industries' Blockchain Application Software Stack. Applications built on top of an Eris stack have access to a number of underlying decentralized or peer-to-peer protocols, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BitTorrent and IPFS, all of which have been harmonized in an interactive layer that can be accessed via JavaScript. 

Using the DeCerver, developers can build blockchain-secure applications which are able to interact with existing decentralised protocols with ease. The DeCerver is easily extensible to work with other network protocols simply by writing a module wrapper.

### Thelonious

#### The Makers' Blockchain Design

Thelonious is our customizable contract-controlled blockchain design. Derived from the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) protocol, but built to meet differing design goals, Thelonious gives developers the ultimate flexibility to define their own state-of-the-art blockchain.

Thelonious differs from other blockchains in that it is not merely smart contract-enabled, it is also smart contract-controlled. As such the design is not meant to be one blockchain, but millions of them, each tailor-made for specific applications.
