### DeCerver

#### The Decentralized Application Server

The DeCerver is the server for Eris Industries' Blockchain Application Software Stack. It has been designed to provide the simplest way to build applications atop a diverse range of proposed and existing decentralized and peer-to-peer protocols. The Decerver provides a JavaScript runtime which interacts with a variety of blockchains and distributed file systems.

Using the DeCerver, developers can build applications which are agnostic to the specifics of the underlying protocols while also being able to use a diversity of blockchains and file systems in concert or independently. The DeCerver is easily extensible to work with other network protocols simply by writing a module wrapper.

### Thelonious

#### The Makers' Blockchain Design

Thelonious is our customizable contract-controlled blockchain design. Derived from the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) protocol, but built to meet differing design goals, Thelonious gives developers the ultimate flexibility to define their own state-of-the-art blockchain. Like Ouroboros, Thelonious provides a Turing complete virtual machine that is itself utilized to define the Thelonious blockchain protocol.

Thelonious was not designed to be one blockchain, but millions of them, each tailor-made by developers for specific contexts and allowing for the easy and secure deployment of applications without needing to spend vast sums of money on servers or mining hardware to secure them.
