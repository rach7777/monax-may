### Thelonious

#### The Makers' Blockchain Design

Thelonious is Eris Industries' customizable, smart-contract enabled, smart-contract controlled blockchain design and one component of our **Distributed Application Software Stack**. Derived from the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) protocol, but built to meet differing design goals, Thelonious gives developers the control to define their own state-of-the-art blockchain. Thelonious is not meant to be one blockchain, but millions of them, each made for specific applications.
