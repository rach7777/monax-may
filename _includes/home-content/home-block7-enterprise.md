### Enterprise Ready

Eris is the first platform that allows the full potential of blockchain based technologies to be realized in business. 

By combining blockchain-housed systems of smart contracts, businesses can take any data-driven human relationship and reduce it to code – guaranteeing accurate and consistent execution of functions which hitherto required human discretion to manage.

We’re working with a number of corporations to discuss how our technology can assist their businesses. If you have a query as to how our solutions can be put to use in your firm, please contact our team at [contact@erisindustries.com](mailto:contact@erisindustries.com).
