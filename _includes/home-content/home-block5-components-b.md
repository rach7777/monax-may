### EPM

#### The Smart Contract Package Manager

The Eris Package Manager allows smart contract developers to deploy and test packages smart contracts to their blockchain clients, and interact with them once deployed. It is the first developer tool explicitly built for our Blockchain Application Software Stack.

The deployment and testing sequence are controlled via smart contract package definition and package testing files, which EPM uses to deploy and test any amount of smart contracts.

### Legal Markdown

#### Putting the "contract" into "smart contract."

Legal Markdown was built to empower the creation of structured legal documents using text based documents. Legal Markdown is a critical component of our Blockchain Application Software Stack and is the backbone of a developers' legal compliance strategy.

When combined with EPM and the DeCerver, Legal Markdown provides an ability to link legal contractual agreements to smart contract architecture in such a way that the legal contract's provisions can be incorporated into the smart contract mechanics.
