### EPM

#### The Smart Contract Package Manager

The Eris Package Manager allows smart contract developers to deploy and test packages smart contracts to their blockchain clients. EPM allows users to transact with smart contracts that have been deployed to the blockchain which is often necessary when establishing a package of contracts on the blockchain. The deployment and testing sequence are controlled via smart contract package definition and package testing files, which EPM uses to deploy and test an indefinite amount of contracts. If you can build it, EPM can compile, deploy, and test it.

### Legal Markdown

#### Legalizing Smart Contracts

Legal Markdown was built to empower the creation of structured legal documents using text based documents. When combined with EPM and the DeCerver, Legal Markdown provides organizations with an ability to simply express and programmatically link legal contractual agreements to smart contract architecture in such a way that the legal contract's content can be designed to reflect, and be incorporated into, the autonomous smart contract mechanics which are designed to automatically enforce it. Put differently, LMD puts the "contract" into "smart contract."
