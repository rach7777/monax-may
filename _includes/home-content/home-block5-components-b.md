### EPM

#### The Smart Contract Package Manager

The Eris Package Manager allows smart contract developers to deploy and test packages smart contracts to their blockchain clients, and interact with them once deployed.

The deployment and testing sequence are controlled via smart contract package definition and package testing files, which EPM uses to deploy and test an indefinite amount of contracts.

### Legal Markdown

#### Putting the "contract" into "smart contract."

Legal Markdown was built to empower the creation of structured legal documents using text based documents.

When combined with EPM and the DeCerver, Legal Markdown provides an ability to link legal contractual agreements to smart contract architecture in such a way that the legal contract's provisions can be incorporated into the smart contract mechanics.
