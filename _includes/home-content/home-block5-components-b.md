### EPM

#### The Smart Contract Package Manager

The Eris Package Manager allows smart contract developers to deploy and test packages of smart contracts to their blockchains, and interact with them once deployed. EPM is both a tool for smart contracts and for blockchain management. It is the first developer tool explicitly built for our **Distributed Application Software Stack** and can be most easily analogized as git, but for blockchains.

### ELM

#### Putting the Contract Into Smart Contract

The Eris Legal Markdown system is the backbone of the **Distributed Application Software Stack**'s legal compliance strategy. When combined with EPM and the Decerver, ELM provides an ability to link real world contractual provisions to smart contract architecture so that users will be able to benefit from the enforceability of real world contracts as well as the automation of smart contract frameworks.
