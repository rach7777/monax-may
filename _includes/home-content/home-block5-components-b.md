### EPM

#### The Smart Contract Package Manager

The Eris Package Manager allows smart contract developers to deploy and test packages of smart contracts to their blockchains, and interact with them once deployed. It is the first developer tool explicitly built for our Distributed Application Software Stack and can be most easily analogized as git, but for blockchains.

### Legal Markdown

#### Putting the "contract" into "smart contract."

Legal Markdown is the backbone of the Distributed Application Software Stack's legal compliance strategy. When combined with EPM and the DeCerver, Legal Markdown provides an ability to link legal contractual agreements to smart contract architecture so that the legal contract's provisions can be incorporated into the smart contract mechanics.
