### EPM

#### The Smart Contract Package Manager

The Eris Package Manager allows smart contract developers to deploy and test packages smart contracts to their blockchain clients, and interact with them once deployed. 

The deployment and testing sequence are controlled via smart contract package definition and package testing files, which EPM uses to deploy and test an indefinite amount of contracts.

### Legal Markdown

#### Legal Structuring for Smart Contracts

Legal Markdown puts the "contract" into "smart contract."

When combined with EPM and the DeCerver, LMD provides organizations with an ability to simply express and programmatically link legal contractual agreements to smart contract architecture in such a way that the legal contract's provisions can be designed to reflect, and be incorporated into, the autonomous smart contract mechanics which are designed to automatically enforce them.
