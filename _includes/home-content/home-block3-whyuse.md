### Manage Complexity

Complex data-driven relationships between people and business require increasingly complex software design infrastructure. Today, Google-scale infrastructure is required to manage these relationships. Distributed infrastructure, however, can perform these tasks much more efficiently.

Through the use of blockchain cryptography, Eris Industries simplifies this software design while providing much of the same utility as traditional, server-based platforms. Any type of information - whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface â€“ is capable of being securely tracked and transferred on an Eris system.

Because Eris Industries uses systems of smart contracts rather than cryptographic tokens to represent this information, Eris Industries systems allow corporates, for the first time, to benefit from blockchain security architecture which is functional, modular, and changeable over time, while also designing systems capable of complying with any and all applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, we enable users to develop blockchain-secure applications which can interact with existing decentralised protocols without needing to rely upon them.
