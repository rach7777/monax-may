### Legal, Compliant Smart Contract Systems

Any type of information – whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely tracked, managed and transferred on smart contracts. The added benefit of using an Eris system to deploy and manage these smart contracts is that legally compliant contracts are first class citizens.

The Eris Industries stack allows for easy integration of real, legally compliant contracts with automated smart contract systems. This integration allows organizations to leverage smart contracts to manage their data driven interactions and legal contracts as an enforcement mechanism when things go awry.

Eris Industries' systems allow organizations, for the first time, to benefit from blockchain security architecture which is functional, modular, and changeable over time, while also designing systems capable of complying with any and all applicable regulatory requirements. We enable developers to build blockchain-secure applications which can interact with existing decentralised protocols without needing to rely upon them.
