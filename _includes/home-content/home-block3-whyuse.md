### Legal, Compliant Smart Contract Systems

Eris Industries has designed a software system which pairs a blockchain with a self-executing, cryptographic script, known as a **smart contract**, which is used to secure and manage the software stack. 

Smart contracts are a significant advance on existing blockchain technology: they are functional, modular, and changeable over time; they can be structured to reflect real-world legal agreements; and they can be designed to comply with any and all applicable regulatory requirements. 

Any type of information – whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely tracked, managed and transferred on smart contracts. 

Furthermore, using our platform, corporate developers can build blockchain-secure applications which are able to interact with existing decentralised protocols with ease.
