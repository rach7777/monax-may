### Legal, Compliant Smart Contract Systems

Eris Industries has designed a software system which pairs a blockchain with a system of self-executing, cryptographic script, known as a **smart contract**, which is used to secure and manage the software stack. 

Smart contracts are a significant advance on existing blockchain technology: they can be structured to reflect and deal in real-world rights and obligations, and can be designed to comply with regulatory requirements. 

Any type of information – whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely tracked, managed and transferred by smart contracts.
