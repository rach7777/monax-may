### Legal, Compliant Smart Contract Systems

Any type of information – whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely tracked, managed and transferred on smart contracts. The added benefit of using an Eris system to deploy and manage these smart contracts is that legally compliant contracts can be first-class citizens.

The Eris Industries stack allows for easy integration of real-world, legally compliant contracts expressible as an automated smart contract system. This allows organizations, such as insurance companies or banks, to leverage smart contracts to manage their data-driven interactions and and to "smart contractify" their legal contracts to reduce oversight costs, improve transparency and automate enforcement.

Eris Industries' systems allow organizations, for the first time, to benefit from blockchain security architecture which is functional, modular, and changeable over time, while also designing systems capable of complying with any and all applicable regulatory requirements. Using our platform, corporate developers can build blockchain-secure applications which can interact with existing decentralised protocols without needing to rely upon them.
