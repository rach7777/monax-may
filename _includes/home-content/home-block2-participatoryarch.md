### Participatory Software Architecture

Eris Industries designs and builds software utilising enterprise-grade cryptography which allows developers to create applications that leverage all of the utility of the modern internet, but without servers.

Eris' open-source platform is easy to set up, easy to parameterise, and fully functional for immediate use by developers. Best of all, it's completely free to use.

The Eris Stack consists of:

**Thelonious**, the world’s first smart contract-controlled blockchain protocol, and

**the DeCerver**, the world’s first decentralised application server.

Using **blockchain** [LINK TO GLOSSARY] technology similar to that of the Bitcoin protocol and its many imitators, and a system of **smart contracts** [LINK TO GLOSSARY] based on the ethereum design, the Eris Industries stack allows developers to build and deploy web applications, written in javascript, that utilize a full suite of public peer-2-peer protocols and can be safely, securely, and reliably deployed on the public internet.

Such applications are known as 'distributed applications,' or **Dapps** [LINK TO GLOSSARY]. 1234
