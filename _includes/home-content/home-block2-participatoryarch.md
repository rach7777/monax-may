### Participatory Software Architecture

Most modern interactive applications require organizations and developers to provide server costs to secure, manage, and maintain an application's data. The costs for these servers are usually offset by stockpiling users' habits, tastes, and relationship data and repackaging that information for advertisers.

Applications built using participatory architecture are different, in that they allow an application's users to participate in the security, management and maintenance of that data.

Eris Industries' **Blockchain Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers to embrace this participatory architecture. These applications, sometimes called Decentralized Applications, Distributed Applications, or just DAPPs, allow developers to leverage all of the utility of the modern internet, but with minimal or nil server costs.

Eris' open-source framework is easy to set up, easy to parameterise, and fully functional for immediate use by developers. Best of all, it's completely free to use. Applications built on top of the Eris framework have access to a number of underlying decentralized or peer-to-peer protocols, all of which have been harmonized in an interactive layer that can be accessed via Javascript.
