### Participatory Software Architecture

Most modern interactive applications require developers to expend vast sums of money to operate them, in the form of server costs and other overheads. These costs are customarily offset by stockpiling users' habits and relationship data and selling this information to advertisers.

Advances in distributed computing free users and developers alike from this reliance on centralized infrastructure, allowing them to play an active part in a given application's security, management and maintenance: what we call "participatory architecture." Participatory architecture allows users to benefit from the interconnectedness of the modern internet without needing to surrender control over their data, or their privacy, to obtain it.

Eris Industries' **Blockchain Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers to embrace participatory architecture and challenge existing providers of "free" internet services such as streaming video, cloud storage and social networking, as well as to design more traditional industrial applications such as asset management and value transfer, at a substantially lower start-up cost than existing infrastructure permits.
