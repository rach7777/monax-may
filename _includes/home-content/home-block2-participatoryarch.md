### Participatory Software Architecture

Most modern interactive applications require developers to expend vast sums of money to secure, manage, and maintain; costs that are usually offset by stockpiling users' habits and relationship data and rebundling it for advertisers.

Applications built using participatory architecture are different. Rather than paying for the application's utility by consenting to deep invasions of their privacy, in participatory architecture users pay for the application's utility by taking part in securing, managing, and maintenance of the applications' data.

Eris Industries' **Blockchain Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers to embrace this architecture.
