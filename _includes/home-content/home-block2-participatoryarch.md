### Participatory Software Architecture

Most web applications require organizations and developers to expend vast sums of money to secure, manage, and maintain. This cost is usually offset by stockpiling users' personal data and repackaging it for advertisers.

Applications built using blockchain technology are different: they use pure mathematics, not an external service provider, in order to secure, manage, and maintain application and user data.

Eris Industries' **Blockchain Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers to embrace this architecture. These applications, called Decentralized Applications or DAPPs, allow developers to leverage all of the utility of the modern internet, but with minimal overheads and without servers.
