### Participatory Software Architecture

Most modern interactive applications require organizations and developers to expend vast sums of money to secure, manage, and maintain. This cost is usually offset by stockpiling users' habits, tastes, and relationship data and repackaging it for advertisers.

Applications built using participatory architecture are different. Participatory architecture allows an applications' users to participate in securing, managing, and maintenance of the applications' data.

Eris Industries' **Blockchain Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers to embrace and participate in this architecture.
