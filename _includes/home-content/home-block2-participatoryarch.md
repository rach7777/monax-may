### Participatory Software Architecture

Most modern interactive applications require organizations and developers to provide server costs to secure, manage, and maintain an application data. The costs for these servers are usually offset by stockpiling users' personal data and repackaging that information for advertisers.

Applications built using participatory architecture are different, in that they allow an application's users to participate in the security, management and maintenance of that data.

Eris Industries' **Blockchain Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers to embrace this participatory architecture. These applications, called Decentralized Applications or DAPPs, allow developers to leverage all of the utility of the modern internet, but with minimal overheads.
