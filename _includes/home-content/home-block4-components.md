### [DECERVER](https://decerver.io)

#### The Decentralized Application Server

The DeCerver is our decentralized application server, designed to provide the simplest and most complete possible development stack for applications built atop a diversity of p2p protocols. By providing a javascript runtime and generalized interfaces for blockchains and distributed file systems, the DeCerver allows developers to build apps (in javascript!) that are agnostic to the specifics of the underlying protocols, enabling them to use a diversity of blockchains and file systems in unison or independently, to whatever effect their application desires.

The DeCerver provides functionality for Thelonious, Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS, and BitTorrent out of the box, and is easily extensible to work with other such network protocols simply by writing a module wrapper. What will you plug into your DeCerver?

### [THELONIOUS](https://thelonious.io)

#### The Makers' Blockchain Design

These databases have their origins in cryptocurrency platforms such as [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org), where they represent historical records of verifiable monetary stake.  In second-generation cryptocurrency platforms, such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), blockchains are generalized to store arbitrary data and to establish permissions to modify that data through a set of self-enforcing and self-executing scripts. These are known as “smart contracts,” and they allow platform operators to define complex and fully customisable rules which govern the blockchain’s interaction with its users.

Like the abstracted layer for data processing that is "the cloud", the blockchain is merely an abstracted layer for computation and the delegation of information processing. In this network, joining is as simple as sending information along with a computable structure file that specifies the intent, or the "contract", upon which the logic applies.

Unlike other projects in the space, however, there is no "pre-sale" and there are no tokens (e.g., bitcoins) - users will not need to "pay to play". Unlike practically every other blockchain project in existence, there is no reason that an Eris platform should ever be anything but free for an ordinary person to use.

Thelonious is our customizable contract-controlled blockchain design. Forked from the open-source Ethereum protocol to give you the ultimate flexibility over a state-of-the-art blockchain, the Thelonious protocol's security and consensus parameters are determined not by the blockchain, but by smart contracts.

Like Ouroboros, Thelonious provides a Turing complete virtual machine that is itself utilized to define the Thelonious blockchain protocol.

Thelonious' 'chief of operations' is GenDoug, a smart contract configured in a particular Thelonious chain's genesis block, through which all protocol validation passes. GenDoug enables developers to "lock-down" their blockchains, specifying which public addresses, if not all of them, are permitted to transact, create new smart contracts, or mine the chain. Furthermore, Thelonious comes with a new algorithm for fault-tolerance in semi-trusted distributed systems, permitting developers to balance trustlessness and security against the needs of their application.

**Thelonious was not designed to be one blockchain, but millions of them,** each tailor-made by developers for specific contexts and allowing for the easy and secure deployment of blockchain-based applications without needing to spend vast sums of money on servers or mining hardware to secure them.

Furthermore, we have reconfigured the network protocol used by most blockchains so that Thelonious will work within existing enterprise routing and firewall infrastructure, so the platform should be useable by individuals, small businesses, and large enterprises alike, without the need to fiddle with routers or enable insecure port mapping software such as upnp.

### [EPM](https://epm.io)

#### Smart Contract Package Manager

The Eris Package Manager (**EPM**) allows Ethereum contract developers to deploy Thelonious smart contracts straight from sublime to their Thelonious clients via rpc.

In addition to deploying contracts from sublime to the Thelonious client, EPM has other features as well, including:
• keeping a log of the smart contracts which have been deployed so that you can then easily transact with those smart contracts;
• allowing users to transact with smart contracts that have been deployed from sublime as well as any others;
• allowing users to query smart contract storage;
• allowing users to deploy a sequence of smart contracts; and
• allowing users to start, stop, and restart servers with predefined options.

All commands are available from the command palette.

### [LEGAL MARKDOWN](https://lmd.io)

#### Legaling Smart Contracts

The LegalMarkdown (LMD) library was built specifically to empower the creation of structured legal documents using simple text based documents and a primary renderer, rather than a bulky and siloed word processor file. As a result, users of LMD will be able to ensure that both the content and style of their documentation are more clearly expressed and less likely to be misinterpreted.

The LMD library provides the user with access to structured headers, internal cross references, optional clauses, mixins, and other features that will greatly simplify the use of text-based documents in legal engineering applications.

Using LMD, contractual agreements can be simply expressed and programmatically linked, with mechanical certainty, to smart contract architecture in such a way that the legal contract's content can be designed to reflect, and be incorporated into, the autonomous smart contract mechanics which are designed to automatically enforce it.

Put differently, LMD puts the "contract" into "smart contract."
