### Making Smart Contracts Work

Participatory architecture is made possible by smart contracts which allow users to securely interact with each other without centralized servers that must be trusted. Any type of information or interaction – whether representations of an asset to be transfered, a task to be completed, or a decision to be taken – is capable of being securely managed, audited, and transferred with and by smart contracts.

Smart contracts can also be structured to reflect and deal in real-world rights, obligations, and regulatory requirements. There should not be a compromise between legal compliance and distributed applications, as we see so often today; smart contracts thus represent a significant advance on existing organizational technology solutions.

Eris Industries' **Distributed Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers simplify and automate data-driven interactions without exposing platform operators to unnecessary legal risk.
