### Making Smart Contracts Work

Participatory architecture is made possible by smart contracts which allow users to securely interact with each other without centralized servers that must be trusted. Any type of information or interaction – whether a representations of an asset to be transfered, a task to be completed, or a decision to be taken – is capable of being securely managed, audited, and transferred with smart contracts.

Smart contracts can also be structured to reflect and deal in real-world rights, obligations, and regulatory requirements without having to surrender legal compliance.

Eris Industries' **Blockchain Application Software Stack** makes it easy for developers begin simplifying and automating data-driven interactions in a fully compliant manner. There should not be a compromise between legal compliance and distributed applications; smart contracts present a significant advance on existing enterprise technology solutions.
