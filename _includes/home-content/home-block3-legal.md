### Making Smart Contracts Work

Participatory architecture used by the Eris Industries Blockchain Applicaiton Software Stack is made possible due to the invention of a type of computer program known as a smart contract. Smart contracts are self-operating and self-enforcing computer programs that allow users to transact with each other securely over the public internet, with highly predictable outcomes, entirely through a user-friendly web-type interface. 

Any type of information – whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely managed, audited, and transferred with smart contracts. In addition to regulating user interactions from an engineering perspective, they can also be structured to reflect and deal in real-world rights, obligations, and regulatory requirements. Smart contracts thus represent a significant advance on existing public-facing enterprise technology solutions.
