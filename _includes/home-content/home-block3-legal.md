### Legal, Compliant Smart Contract Systems

Smart contracts are a significant advance on existing legal technology solutions. They can be structured to reflect and deal in real-world rights and obligations. They can be designed to comply with regulatory requirements.

Any type of information – whether it be representations of monetary value, asset ownership, or even a web-type application interface – is capable of being securely tracked, managed, and transferred on smart contracts.

The Eris Industries stack allows for easy integration of real, legally compliant contracts with automated smart contract systems, allowing organizations and individuals to leverage smart contracts to manage their data driven interactions and legal contracts as an enforcement mechanism when things go awry.
