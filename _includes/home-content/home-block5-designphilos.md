### Design Philosophy

Most blockchains in use today are built to transfer tokens representing monetary value among a network of mutually, and equally, untrustworthy actors. As such, they are built to be standalone monoliths, with the result that their security and consensus models are stagnant and resistant to change.

But modern internet services require flexibility and adaptability on the part of platform operators and service providers, who are incentivised to conduct themselves properly out of good commercial practice. Developers wishing to utilise blockchain technology deserve a platform which allows them to benefit from purpose-built distributed blockchain architecture without being tied to ossified protocols which are not fit for purpose.

At Eris Industries, we feel it is tedious, clumsy, and ultimately unnecessary for every aspiring distributed application developer to build entirely atop a public, fully trustless chain like Bitcoin. We give developers the tools to set their own levels of trustlessness and security in their blockchains, and to build applications on top of those chains which easily interface with other blockchains and p2p protocols.

Think of us as the node.js of p2p.
