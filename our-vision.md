Our vision is to build a smarter, more secure world - one that comes out to meet the user, not the other way around.

Take for example the process of booking a hotel. Normally a customer would go to that hotel's web site, figure out how to use its specific implementation of a booking system, check if rooms are available, try to book one, enter his details, and provide all manner of personal information to multiple operators of multiple, sometimes incompatible, platforms.

There is a difference between Google leveraging the amount of data they collect to run a costly, centralised infrastructure which provides you with hints of what you might be interested in and an integrated network which allows you to securely and directly transact without surrendering any personal data at all. Take, for example, what Google is trying to do with their “Google Now” platform, with predictive analytics that meet the user “halfway”. If I am in a new area, it will suggest “points of interest”. It will show “cards” that suggest the route home to me, if I am not home. It suggests nearby hotels, restaurants, venues and their ratings. This is a step in the right direction, but it is still merely a middle-man - merely a portal. It can’t seamlessly and securely transact on my behalf. But a smart contract-capable blockchain can. 

Ordinary users deserve to benefit from the interconnectivity of the web and the security of the blockchain without the security or commercial drawbacks either platform presents today.
