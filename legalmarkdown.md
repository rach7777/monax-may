The LegalMarkdown (LMD) library was built specifically to empower the creation of structured legal documents using simple text based documents and a primary renderer, rather than a bulky and siloed word processor file. As a result, users of LMD will be able to ensure that both the content and style of their documentation are more clearly expressed and less likely to be misinterpreted. 

The LMD library provides the user with access to structured headers, internal cross references, optional clauses, mixins, and other features that will greatly simplify the use of text-based documents in legal engineering applications.

Using LMD, contractual agreements can be simply expressed and programmatically linked, with mechanical certainty, to smart contract architecture in such a way that the legal contract's content can be designed to reflect, and be incorporated into, the autonomous smart contract mechanics which are designed to automatically enforce it. 

Put differently, LMD puts the "contract" into "smart contract."
